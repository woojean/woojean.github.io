# 前言

《无物》初版于**1981年**问世。 此次推出第二版，进行了全面修订，但同时也尽力保留了原著的基本神韵与风味。 《无物》带着青春的笃定——彼时我37岁——但从当下的视角来看，这正是它的魅力所在。 如今愈发明白，我对万事万物皆是无知，尤其是书中所论之事。而我却甚喜如此。

*摘自1981年序言：* 此书源于1980年3月的一次体验，虽未臻至圆满，却让我瞥见了另一种现实，或许更准确地说，是另一种看待现实的方式。 为了传达这段体验，书中引用了诸多来源的故事与理念。耶稣、佛陀、拜伦·凯蒂、奥修、老子等人类的恩师，他们的思想影响深远。 我也深受其他导师的影响，如拉姆·达斯、沃纳·埃哈德、肯·凯斯、马哈高沙纳达、我的朋友理查德·戈贝勒以及更多人。

*本书的问世，得益于霍华德·布朗、卡罗尔·施罗德、约翰·威克斯、已故的伟大阿尔弗雷德·卡普勒等人的慷慨相助。* *近来，我也要感谢这些心怀善意的人：比尔·安德森、丽贝卡·贝尔、雷安·伯恩汉姆、汤姆和尼尔扎·卡洛斯、约翰·凯泽、佩吉·麦克凯、丹·马塞勒斯、玛丽·波林、范和卡拉·瑟普、弗朗茨·瓦诺维茨、大卫·沃特豪斯、卡罗琳·怀特黑德、汤姆·扎加拉，尤其是卡罗尔·斯蒂芬森。还有许多人，谢谢你们。* *特别感谢我的前妻托尼亚·威克斯、我的母亲安·罗曼丘克以及我的伙伴乔安妮·蒙利，感谢他们那颗宽广的心。* *在此书中，我想特别向奥修致以敬意。他对我早年的生命产生了深远而积极的影响，我在此表达对他特殊的感激之情。我尽可能地在书中融入了他对神秘的美妙隐喻。* *最后，我想感谢那些无法在此一一提及、却以深刻方式触动我生命的人。谢谢你们。*

最后，我想向古今中外、在各个角落默默耕耘、为世界带来福祉的无数人们致以敬意。你们是我前行的榜样。

**本书所述，皆是千百年来以不同方式被反复提及的真理。** 希望这种独特的编排与表达，能让你从中获得些许启发。




# 心
## 第一章
一个真实的故事... 它涉及亚历山大大帝，世界征服者，和第欧根尼，一个在公元前四世纪住在雅典的神秘主义者。第欧根尼除了一个乞讨碗之外一无所有，有一天他甚至把这仅有的东西也扔掉了。第欧根尼以他宁静、极乐的状态而闻名。亚历山大听说过他，想要见他。

这是历史上更有趣的会面之一。第欧根尼正在河岸上晒太阳，当征服者接近时。亚历山大凝视着那些沉默、极乐的眼睛，告诉第欧根尼他非常钦佩他，然后问是否有什么他可以为他做的。

第欧根尼停顿了一会儿，然后说：“是的，有一件事你可以为我做。你可以稍微移开一点，你挡住了阳光。”

一个诡异而美丽的回答。世界上最强大的人正在提供任何东西，而第欧根尼要求他不要挡住阳光。**这里是一个不需要任何东西的人。**

亚历山大说：“当我完成征服世界后，我将过来加入你，在河岸上放松。”

第欧根尼回答：“没有必要先征服世界。我没有征服世界，我正在放松。**是什么阻止了你？你可以现在就放松。**”

亚历山大说：“不，我必须先征服世界。”然后第欧根尼对他说：“你永远不会完成。你将在其中死去。”亚历山大确实如此。在一场战争中，他去世了。

<font color=red>这就是我们的心灵，总是需要先做点什么才能放松</font>。事实上，它永远无法放松，因为它总是被占据。心灵的疾病是不断的占据。如果心灵停止被占据，它就简单地停止存在。它就像鲨鱼，必须保持移动才能呼吸。**没有移动，心灵就会死亡**。

即使说它会死亡也是不正确的，因为移动本身才是心灵。它不是鲨鱼，而是移动本身。**当移动停止时，心灵已经不存在** **因为它从未真正存在过。** 但是移动——心灵的不断占据——使它看起来好像存在。

心灵被什么占据？

被思想、情感、感觉、欲望、目标、问题、偏好、活动等等占据。任何被说、被做、被感觉或被思考的东西都是心灵的。所有这些都是心灵，而心灵总是在移动。心灵可以与舞蹈相比。没有移动就没有舞蹈，一旦移动停止，就没有舞蹈。

看起来我们的生活中有许多问题。但大师们说只有一个：心灵。只有那一个问题，他们说，如果那个问题解决了，那么所有其他问题都会立即解决，它们简单地停止存在，因为它们首先除了心灵本身的问题之外，从未存在过。 <font color=red>心灵创造了我们所有的问题</font>，他们说，无论我们解决多少问题，除非我们解决心灵本身的基本问题，否则更多的问题会出现。

这就像一棵树，我们一片片地剪掉叶子，一个接一个地解决问题。但我们也很惊讶，因为每剪掉一片叶子，就会出现三片。每个园丁都知道，使树变稠的方法是修剪它。因此，每解决一个问题，就会出现其他问题；这个过程永远不会结束。我们解决这个无休止的问题系列，变得筋疲力尽。

如果我们足够深入地观察，我们会看到这个过程永远不会结束；新的叶子总是会继续生长。所以我们必须观察的不是叶子，而是根——心灵——因为那里才是真正的问题所在。如果我们剪掉根，所有的叶子会同时枯萎。

所以让我们<font color=red>观察根</font>，而不是叶子。让我们<font color=red>观察心灵本身的性质</font>。



## 第二章
此性为何？<font color=red>此乃心之本性，恒常追寻，恒常欲求</font>。心乃追逐者，目标追寻之机制。**心总欲往他处，故而从未在此处**。观吾辈自语：“待吾觅得良伴，一切自会安好。”“一旦加薪，吾便可安心。”“待房屋扩建完成，吾便能尽享欢愉。”“此难题一过，吾便心生欢喜。”

吾辈之心常驻于未来，从未在此处。幸福总似遥不可及之目标，待诸事解决方可达成。然吾辈可曾察觉？一难题甫解，新难题又至；一目标达成，新目标又生。此乃心之本性，心为追求目标之物。若无目标，若无欲求，心便无法存续。心必有动，必有所向，此乃其本性也。

那么，<font color=red>何为心之难题？</font>心之难题，乃心所不能接受之事。**此乃心欲某事与现状不同之欲求**。是某种与心之理想模型不符之境遇。

**若吾辈无欲某事与现状不同，则无难题可言**。然心常有一串欲求之事，故而常有许多难题待解。此令心忙碌，令心存续。

```
无欲某事与现状不同？
```

心所钻研之终极难题为何？<font color=red>其终极难题乃死亡</font>。心不愿被毁灭，且<font color=red>常怀恐惧</font>，因知死亡可随时降临。若吾辈深入内观，可见一丝颤抖，一丝紧张——那便是对毁灭的恐惧。**心常研此难题，思忖如何存续**。其目标乃寻一法，令自身永存，若能永恒则更好。

为缓解此内惧，心试图积聚更多之安全感、权力与欢愉。心化作收藏者。它收藏更多之地位、声望、财富、财物。它收藏更多之知识、数据、答案。它收藏更多之感受，而后又求更多。更多饮食、更多情欲、更多冒险。更多伴侣、朋友或盟友。更多科技。更多房屋、汽车、衣物、书籍，更多体验，更多解决方案。**吾辈虽各不同，然皆欲求更多某物。此乃心之本性也**。

然无论积聚多少，无论收藏几何，皆无法满足内心之恐惧与颤抖，因<font color=red>所有收藏皆为外物，而恐惧与颤抖皆为内情</font>。外物永难满足内心。是故心贪婪无厌。它不断积聚，期望填满内心之空洞，然永难填满，于是继续积聚、欲求、追寻。此戏永无止境，直至死亡之日。**吾辈常死于中途——死于追逐所欲之途中**。




## 第三章
心被喻为醉酒之猴，在林间穿梭不息，因其无尽的活动从未停歇。观猴之态，它总是有所动作：或挠痒，或抓耳，或觅食，或四处张望；唯有入眠时方能稍歇。再观吾辈之心念，亦具此特质。<font color=red>吾辈之心念在诸事之间无尽跳跃</font>。“此桌……乃硬木所制……它从何而来？……想必是俄勒冈州……不知那地如何……听说常有雨……近来此地雨水甚少……农人需雨……务农实乃艰辛……” 如此这般，永无止境。

无尽的思虑化作无尽的活动。即便在放松之时，吾辈也常处于忙碌之中：嚼口香糖、翻阅杂志、听广播、做饭、吃零食、阅读、看电视。于心而言，问题总是：“接下来呢？”于是吾辈从吃饭到交谈，到工作，到亲昵，到阅读，到看电影，到去海边，再到吃饭，再到参加聚会……永无止境。

“接下来呢？”心获得片刻的满足，但瞬间即逝，心又欲求更多。它再获满足，那满足亦转瞬即逝；而后又欲求更多，如此往复，<font color=red>无止境</font>。**心永难安于当下，于心而言，当下仅是通往彼岸的手段。

是故，心本质上常陷于苦厄，因<font color=red>它永难安于当下此刻</font>。

<font color=red>吾辈之心所绘之行动图景，皆基于过往之记忆</font>。它以过去为凭借，试图抵达未来。因心常驻于过去或未来，故而多为苦厄。

<font color=red>苦厄不过是从未安于当下、总在别处的另一种说法</font>。这苦厄被压抑，以免吾辈察觉，但它始终存在。即便吾辈看似心情愉悦，那深藏的苦厄依然如影随形。

看似吾辈安于当下，然几近总是并非如此。若吾辈洗碗，那并非只是洗碗。吾辈先设定了一个短期目标，或许自己都未曾察觉——洗完碗。吾辈欲通过洗碗达成某事。

与此同时，吾辈心念纷飞：鲍勃昨日所言……今夜之晚餐……哦，该浇水了……凯莉多么美丽……但她总把屋内温度调得过高……如此这般，永无止境。而过往洗碗时烫伤手的记忆又在心中泛起。吾辈并非安于当下。

```
意识在不停流动
```

心永难真正嬉戏，因<font color=red>嬉戏乃当下的事，其中无过去亦无未来</font>。寻乐便是做某事而无任何目标，既非追求愉悦，亦非为了完成。那只是嬉戏、欢闹；并无目的。

<font color=red>真正的嬉戏对心而言难以理解</font>，因在心看来，万事皆需有目的，皆需服务于某种结局，皆需有其意义。否则，有何意义？然而，**乐趣与嬉戏本无意义；这便是它们的意义。它们只是它们自身。**

奥修曾讲述一位擅长射箭的求道者的故事。他几乎每次都能命中靶心。他前往日本，拜一位射箭大师为师，欲从其处获得证书。在日本，人们常借各种借口教授禅定，射箭便是其中之一。求道者一次次命中靶心，但大师只说：“**是你在射箭。箭应自行射出**。”

此言荒诞。箭如何能自行射出？求道者继续命中靶心。而后他刻意不中靶心，亦未成功。大师说：“靶心非靶心。<font color=red>汝即靶心</font>。”**大师所关注的并非结局，而是起点。**

求道者未能从大师处获得证书，三年后他放弃离去，收拾行囊准备回家。他去向正在射箭场上的大师告别。

求道者坐下观看，此刻他不再执着于证书，已然放下。他第一次真正看到了大师。**大师只是在嬉戏，无人在意是否命中靶心**。求道者接过弓，拉弓搭箭。此刻他不再纠结，**只是在嬉戏**。箭尚未离弦，大师便转过身去，说道：“完成了。靶心已中。”

内心深处，吾辈之心总是严肃的，总是试图达成目标。<font color=red>心无法理解，目标已然在此</font>，因它本性便是不断追求目标。

```
You are the target.
given that up and just having fun.
```

是故，心几乎总是处于挣扎之中，总是试图达成。它总是努力，陷入困境与阻碍之中。

心从未察觉，<font color=red>这无尽的追寻才是真正的难题</font>。它从未察觉，其试图寻找解决方案的努力，正是阻碍它看到无需解决方案的真相的根源。这就好比一池浑水，吾辈在池中搅动以澄清泥沙，而这搅动正是让水保持浑浊、阻碍吾辈看清水面之下神秘底部的原因。




## 第四章
心向诸目标之运动，皆基于分别。<font color=red>世间本为一体，然心以标签、概念、分类将其割裂为多端</font>。心乃贴标签者，对万事万物皆贴以标签。“此乃树，彼乃篱。此在动，彼静止。此为红，彼为橙。他衣着得体，她则平平。男孩俊朗，其父不然。今日阴霾，可惜，昨日尚晴。”

<font color=red><b>心遂透过其构建与概念感知实相，而非直接感知</b></font>。实验表明，若向人展示一张红桃A，彼将视其为红心A，因其心中有“红即红心或方块”之概念。另有实验显示，若众人事先串通声称看见某物，即便该物并不存在，未入局之观察者亦会看见。彼等真真切切地看见了不存在之物，因心算计着它本应存在。

事实上，一切标签，<font color=red>一切概念皆生出对立</font>。欲创“树”之分类，必同时创“非树”之分类，即一切非树之物。否则，“树”之分类便无意义。吾辈所有分类皆如此。“上”无“下”则无意义。某物之所以为“上”，乃因有另一“下”之物与之相对。此二概念同时生起。**实相中并无“上”或“下”**。此类标签皆为心之所造。

```
有无相生，相反相成。
```

同理，“美”无“丑”则不存。“善”无“恶”则无依。皆为心之所创。**心之体验由其理论所定，进而又强化了这些理论**。

经由某种体验，吾辈立一信念，譬如认为蓄须男子皆不礼貌。而后发现，凡蓄须男子皆符此规。吾辈将此期待带入每一情境，于是便总是正确。

心渴望在任何代价下都正确，因**心乃诸多观点之集合**。故而，其观点正确，便等同于生存。而后，当吾辈遇到一位不礼貌的蓄须男子时，吾辈依然正确，因他成了“证明规则的例外”。而他稍有差池，吾辈便说：“看吧？我就知道。蓄须男子皆不礼貌。”<font color=red>心活在其自身之实相中</font>。

有一则哈西德故事讲到此事。曾有一位哈西德大师，成为了一名法官。因其极为觉知，故而不执着于正确，而是在一切中看见正确。第一桩案件呈上，法官听完原告陈述后说道：“对。你说得对。”

法庭书记将他拉到一边，说道：“你疯了吗？你只听了一方之词，怎能断言正确？”法官说：“你说得对。让我们听听被告。”听完被告陈述后，法官说道：“是的，对。你说得完全正确。”书记再次将法官拉到一边，说道：“现在你真的疯了。你做了绝不该做的事，你让双方都对了。”法官说：“当然，你说得对。双方怎能都对呢？”

这与心之所为截然相反。<font color=red>心执着于其观点，执着于其正确性。心乃执着者</font>。一旦心开始分别，便开始偏好此物而非彼物。它将一体割裂为多端，而后在多端中挑三拣四。它偏好棕榈树而非杉树，或反之。它偏好蓝色而非红色，或偏好高个女子而非矮个，或偏好大房子而非小房子，或偏好声望而非耻辱，或诸如此类。欲望由此而生。

此刻之所存已不再足够。此刻须先获得某物，方能足够。而另一些东西则须被推开。心执着于其所好，试图避开其所恶。它依附于其欲望、偏好、观点、信念与目标。它依附于人、财物、金钱、权力、青春。它执着于特定的解决方案、答案、仪式、习惯态度、行事方式以及事物应有的模式。心变得如同枯木一般僵硬而脆弱。**它失去了生命的灵动，于内已然死去**。但它依然执着，因它将此等同于生存。

<font color=red>心最基本的观点，最基本的对立，便是认为自身是分离的</font>。这一假设如此根本，以至于心甚至无法将其视为一种假设。这就好比水之于鱼。心将其视为存在的一个既定事实。它不会质疑这一范式，因为这一范式深到连自身都无法被察觉。或许在理智层面可以，但在血肉之躯的层面，却不能。

```
分别心
```

而这一范式影响着生活的方方面面。自然而然地，<font color=red>由于心感到分离，它便必须挣扎、奋斗、求生，让事情变得正确</font>。

事实上，正确与否这一问题，是心最为有趣的特点之一。心认为许多事物是错误的，因为它认为许多事物直接或间接地威胁到了其作为独立个体的生存。

若有人偷走了我们的电脑，那便是“错”的，因为心将其视为对生存的威胁。若有人或某物与我们心中的模型不符，我们便称其为“错”。

所有的心皆有疾，但**检验一颗心病重与否的简单方法，便是观察其有多少“抱怨”**。




## 第五章
有一天，七里居敬大师正在冥想，一个小偷拿着刀闯了进来，威胁他交出钱来，不然就要他的命。大师说：“别打扰我。”然后指着那边的抽屉说：“钱就在那个抽屉里。”小偷拿了钱，正准备离开，大师又说：“记得要谢谢我。”小偷谢了他，就走了。

后来小偷因为其他罪行被抓，也坦白了他偷大师钱的事。大师被叫去作证，问他到底发生了什么，七里说：“有个人来，我送了他一份钱的礼物，他谢了我，然后就走了。根本没有什么小偷。”

<font color=red>我们每个人都是通过自己注意到的东西来创造自己的现实</font>，通过我们叠加在事物上的概念和解释。 <font color=red>现实本身是无法用心去了解的</font>。我们的感官其实只是很小的窗口。比如我们的视觉，也只是整个电磁光谱中的一小部分。

而且对于那些我们能感知到的数据，我们的感官还会过滤掉大部分。比如研究发现，青蛙的眼睛只对昆虫那种近距离的移动感兴趣，其他视觉信息都被过滤掉了。

而大脑接收到的那一点点数据，**还得经过大脑的解释**，我们才能有视觉或其他感官的体验。我们根本没法确定大脑是不是完全在内部制造出这些体验——也许我们以为的感官数据其实只是大脑内部的计算结果。

换句话说，<font color=red>我们根本不知道外面到底有什么</font>，我们其实完全不知道外部世界到底是什么样的。而且<font color=red>说不定外面根本什么都没有，我们所有的感官数据可能只是大脑完全内部产生的</font>。我们没法确定。

但我们的所有概念、信念、观点、知识，最终都是基于感官数据的。**现实的本质是无法用心去了解的。**比如有个人坐在房间里，一只蚂蚁也在房间里爬来爬去。蚂蚁感知到的现实和那个人的完全不一样。哪个才是正确的？两个都是。又都不是。谁都没感知到真正的现实，只是各有各的版本。

道家大师**庄子**说过：“你怎么能和井底之蛙谈大海呢？”心总是困在自己那个小井里，被有限的数据限制，然后又被自己对这些数据形成的概念和信念进一步限制。然后这些概念、信念、态度、模型等等又成了过滤器，通过它来感知和解释新的数据。<font color=red>心活在自己的井里，还以为自己的井就是全部</font>。它以为自己的井就是真实的样子，以为自己的井就是大海本身。

另一种看待心这种幻觉现实的方式是，把心看成一个投影仪，把现实只当作一个屏幕，用来投射它自己的版本。心把自己的幻想、态度、概念和模型投射到现实中，然后把这种电影当成了现实本身。

心是个做梦的机器，而且它从来都不停地做梦。它把自己的梦当成现实，就像我们在睡觉时做的梦在梦里是真实的。<font color=red>我们眼中的现实其实也是一种梦。我们创造了它，制造了它。我们对周围世界的体验完全是我们的创造；我们完全要为它负责。</font>

所以当我们看到“不对劲”的地方时，就觉得外面的东西必须得改。我们怎么可能通过外部手段去改变一个幻觉呢？既然它是完全内部的东西，那我们改掉一个“不对劲”，还会冒出更多，但那种觉得东西不对劲的感觉可以一直持续下去。

屏幕上的画面可能在变，但那不是问题；问题是投影仪是不是还开着。<font color=red>除非我们深入探究心本身的本质，不然我们就会一直去改那个梦——但我们还是在做梦</font>。

还有一种表达心这种幻觉现实的方式是说，<font color=red>心总是处于嗑药状态，它总是让自己迷醉</font>。心是个瘾君子。那它的毒品是什么？它的毒品是权力、财富、地位、知识、声望。它的毒品是食物、性、冒险、酒精和药片。它的毒品是成就、目标、拯救世界、迷恋、融入群体、创造力。它的毒品是各种信念和故事。它的毒品是仇恨、愤怒、嫉妒、快乐、忧郁等等。

心总是迷醉的，它永远看不到真实。心想让自己嗨起来，这样就不用去体验自己的痛苦了。但嗨起来的本性就是总会下来。等心下来了，它马上就会找另一种毒品，让自己再嗨起来。它想要一个新的男人或女人，一份新的工作，一个新的城市，一件新的衣服，一部新的电影。这个过程一直持续，**心从来都不明白，它的毒品根本不是解决问题的办法**。

心永远都不会明白，因为<font color=red>心活在希望里</font>。明天会更好。但明天永远不会来，也永远来不了，因为等它来了，就总是今天。未来永远不会到来。唯一存在的只有当下这一刻。<font color=red>如果我们仔细看，就会发现正是希望本身，正是欲望本身创造了时间</font>。

想象一下，你安静地坐着，没有任何欲望，很幸福，很平静。这时候是没有时间的。我们只是活在永恒的瞬间。现在让一个欲望进入我们的内心，我们又回到了时间里。如果实现这个欲望需要一个月，那我们就创造了一个月的时间。如果需要一个小时，那我们就创造了一个小时的时间。

我们不仅有一个，而是有成千上万个大小欲望。所以时间永远都不够。我们觉得时间从我们身边溜走了，生活从我们身边过去了。这就是我们害怕死亡的原因，因为我们还需要更多时间。我们还没实现自己的欲望，还没完成自己想做的事。我们需要更多时间，但时间又不够。这都是欲望造成的。如果我们没有欲望，我们也不会害怕死亡；我们会准备好面对它。

<font color=red>心因为欲望而活在地狱里</font>。你有没有注意到？当我们痛苦的时候，时间过得很慢，好像拖拖拉拉的。从根本上说，心总是痛苦的，因为它总是活在当下之外。这就是地狱的样子。它看起来就像我们活在当下之外时的生活。

反过来，如果我们没有欲望，没有目标，我们会完全幸福，时间会变得飞快，直到没有时间——只剩下这一刻。那才是天堂，是天堂。但心做不到，因为它充满了欲望。欲望就是它的本质。




## 第六章
当心终于看见自身的痛苦时，便踏上了一场精神之旅。此刻，它不再渴望金钱、权力、财物、欢愉，而是渴望神、天堂、觉悟、转变。然而，若我们深入观照，便会发现，一切未曾改变。**目标虽异，本质相同，心仍在追寻**。

而正是这追寻，构成了心的全部存在。<font color=red>心是运动，心是执着</font>。在这场精神之旅中，心通常会陷入形而上学的教义之中，而后执着于这些教义，为它们争论不休，仿佛在做着什么重要的事。

有一则真实的故事。一位禅宗学生问：“师父，我们死后会怎样？会轮回吗？若会轮回，我们会保留记忆还是失去记忆？我们的人格特质会保留还是丧失？轮回之前要等多久？或者，轮回的整个概念是错误的，西方关于永恒灵魂的观念才是正确的？若是这样，我们在天堂或地狱中会保留记忆还是失去记忆？在人间与天堂之间，还有其他境界吗？”

“你的早餐要凉了。”师父回答。

<font color=red>心能理解复杂之事，却难以理解简单之事</font>。生命是简单的……一场日落，一场暴雨，一朵花。生命如此简单，以至于超出了我们的理解。心无法理解它，<font color=red><b>无法理解仅仅活在当下，没有任何目的或目标</b></font>。于是，心总是试图把生命装进一个盒子，去构建它，从看似混乱中创造出秩序。当面对无限与未知时，心会感到极度焦虑，于是它执着于自己的盒子和结构，拼命地去确定。

它提出问题。为何有痛苦？为何有疾病？为何有仇恨？为何有痛苦？为何有死亡？<font color=red>心渴望答案</font>。

它未曾看到，正是这种不满的感觉，催生了提问和寻找答案的冲动。当我们快乐时，我们不会问为何爱存在。当我们健康时，我们不会问为何健康存在。只有当痛苦和不满出现时，问题才会产生。

心总是处于痛苦之中，因为它总是试图去到别处；因此，它寻找答案。如果它能安于当下，如果它能活在当下，所有问题都会从它身上脱落。那时，便无需答案。然而，心无法放下执着，因为执着就是它的本质。心是生病的；只有生病时，才会寻找药方。

心想要为存在强加秩序，因为存在太过狂野、太过混乱。正如奥修所说，正当我们凭借智慧和方式安定下来时……我们便死了。而后，一个新生儿被带到世间，一无所知，甚至不知道自己是谁。

这是混乱！大树死去，小种子发芽。星系消亡，新的星系诞生。这是混乱！如果心得其所愿，便不会有死亡，然而，也不会有生命。一切都将是完美的、机械的、高效的、有序的——然而，也是死的。因为新的事物将无法出现。

混乱使新的事物成为可能；这就是它的意义所在。<font color=red>心将自己束缚于规则、教义、态度、“应该”</font>，而后又疑惑为何生命的滋味已消散，为何生活越来越像是走马观花。心成了自己所造盒子的囚徒。

<font color=red>心是个完美主义者</font>，试图找到那些恰到好处的结构和答案。它是个理想主义者，试图达到某个遥不可及的目标——政治的、道德的、法律的、文化的、科学的、艺术的、经济的、宗教的，无论什么。只有那些看似不可能的目标，才真正具有吸引力，因为**只有不可能之事，才看起来完美**。

心一次次达不到自己的理想……一次次尝试，一次次失败，一次次痛苦……这场游戏永无止境。这是一种自我实现的旅程，不可能之事必须被达成。

唯有那些可能之事、不完美之事，才是人类的。心总是渴望超人之事，而超人之事总是非人的。<font color=red><b>对心来说，最难之事，莫过于平凡、自然、不特别</b></font>。

相反，自我/心努力让自己变得独特、特别、非凡。它渴望脱颖而出，被人注意。<font color=red>事实上，这种渴望非凡的欲望是绝对平凡的，因为它无处不在，这就是心的日常本性</font>。

而<font color=red>心是个极端主义者</font>，为了让自己独特和特别，它在两个极端之间摇摆。<font color=red>它永远无法仅仅保持平衡，因为那样它就不存在了</font>。心本身就是失衡，它会不惜一切代价去变得特别。如果它在追求欢愉中失败，它就会开始追求痛苦。如果它认为通过贬低自己可以变得优越，它就会去做。如果它在生命中未能成功，它就会寻求自杀，寻求死亡。

最重要的是，<font color=red>心是个行动者</font>。总得做些什么——关于自己的生命，关于这个世界，关于他人，关于这个情境和那个情境。心天生具有暴力性，它总是愿意在必要时使用武力。为了实现它那完美的理想，或许需要使用强迫。<font color=red>对心而言，目的可以为手段正名</font>。

它想要掰开花蕾以得到玫瑰，而后又惊讶于花瓣落地，手中却什么也没有。

```
Mind is a perfectionist.
mind is an extremist.
mind is a doer.
```



## 第七章
这便是心：它感到孤立无援，独自一人，觉得需要生存下去。它看到世间万物皆有“错”，想要改变一切，包括自身的一部分，让它们变得“对”。它是行动、运动、挣扎、奋斗——<font color=red>总想抵达某处，却从未安住当下</font>。它是以自我为中心的，自私的，<font color=red>总在一切事物中盘算自己的回报</font>——即便在利他行为中也是如此。

而它的回报是什么？是它的态度、观点、见解、信念、辩解、行为、故事、呈现的存续。回报就是它能“对”。最终，心是个自我欺骗者。它受苦，却说服自己还算快乐。它活在过去与未来，却说服自己活在当下。它一无所知，却说服自己知晓真理。

现在，让我们再深入一些。首先要注意的是，<font color=red>心是一群人</font>……一时满足，一时悲伤，一时嫉妒，一时沮丧，一时愉悦，一时无聊。并无统一可言。不同的时刻，不同的“演员”登台亮相。如此多的念头！……拉扯着你东奔西跑，一会儿这个主题，一会儿那个主题，不断变化。

若我们将情绪与感受也视为不同类型的念头，便会发现，念头如过江之鲫，每一个都与前一个不同。它们是混杂的，是组合的……是一群人。

而一群人的最有趣之处在于，其实并无“一群人”这回事。我们能找到一群人群之外的东西吗？不能。一群人群是个抽象概念。只有一个个个体存在，但它们聚在一起，便给人一种除了个体之外还有别的东西存在的错觉。然而，只有个体存在。

**心亦复如是。<font color=red>若我们仔细观察，便会发现并无“心”这回事</font>。只有一个个独立的念头。**一个念头接着一个念头，无穷无尽，给人一种除了念头本身之外还有别的东西存在的感觉，但其实并没有。**若我们去寻找心，永远也找不到。\**我们能找到的，只有一个个独立的念头。\**<font color=red>心是个抽象概念，它并不存在</font>。**

那么，这“我”的感觉，这独立存在的感觉，又是什么呢？它本身**是一系列的念头**，正如佛陀首先指出的那样。事实上，我们无时无刻不在想自己。电话公司曾做过一项研究，发现人们使用频率最高的词就是“我”**。这个“我”，其实是一种**假设，是无数念头连续不断形成的结论。它本身就是一个念头。**

```
I = a series of thoughts
```

若我们观察自己的念头，便会发现它们就像玻璃杯或椅子一样，是实实在在的东西。<font color=red size=4><b>每一个念头都如同海浪从海洋中升起</b></font>。**它无端出现，存在片刻，然后又消失回它来的地方。**

每一个念头自生自灭，**不受任何控制**。问问自己：你能改变昨天的念头吗？不能。你能改变明天的念头吗？不能。你能改变此刻的念头吗？不能。因为“此刻”已然过去。你可能会惊讶地发现——你无法改变任何一个念头。“你”对它们毫无掌控。它们自生自灭，是独立的存在。

这就是心的困境。它想要掌控一切，还幻想着自己能掌控自己的决定。它自认为是选择者、决定者、自我引导者。但实际上，它并不选择，也不决定，也不引导任何东西，因为它并不存在。它的所有选择和决定，不过是一个个念头自生自灭罢了。

讽刺的是，心花费大量时间去挣扎、奋斗以掌控一切，却**实际上什么也掌控不了，因为它并不存在**。没有自我引导者，没有选择者，没有决定者。并不是说念头不存在，它们是存在的。但并无一个中心去引导它们。并无一个中心，那只是个幻觉。心自认为是掌控者、选择者，而这正是不存在的东西。心本身并不存在。

心害怕失去掌控。它害怕失控，因为它将自己视为掌控者。失控就意味着不存在。<font color=red>在最深的层面，心无法放手，因为那意味着放手自己的存在</font>。

然而，矛盾的是，心本就不存在，它只是以为自己存在。它本就不做任何选择，只是以为自己在选择。存在的，只是一个个孤立的念头，一个接一个，其中有一些念头认为存在一个自我引导的实体，这个实体在做决定，它知晓真理，它还算快乐，等等。

于是，我们看到了一个奇妙的景象：一个实际上不存在的东西，却花费时间试图存活。

这并非学术问题。因为心是什么？是我们。我们所有的念头、情绪、态度、观点、行为、故事、呈现以及行为模式，都是心。<u>**我们是心，心就是我们**</u>。

**若我们以为自己有某个部分与心无关，再仔细看看。我们并无任何部分不是心。我们所认为的自己的任何东西，其实都是心。**

```
mind = 心
```



## 第八章
说“心”不存在，意味着“你”和“我”也不存在。我们以为自己在做决定，但其实并无一个“人”在做这些决定。“你”和“我”作为自我引导者、掌控者、选择者，是不存在的。家里没有人。存在的，只是念头……**以及通过一个伺服机制在活动中表达自己的念头**。我们所认为的“我们”，不过是一个又一个的念头。并无一个中心。“你”和“我”，都是幻象。

<font color=red>事实上，我们完全是一个刺激/反应机制。一个机器</font>。一个极其复杂的机器，但仍然是一个机器。通常，我们习惯于只把点唱机和台球这类物体视为完全处于刺激-反应范畴之内。我们在点唱机上按下按钮，它就会播放《白色圣诞》。我们击打一个台球，它就会在桌上滚动。

现在，让我们上升到植物的层次。植物是一种被设定为以特定方式对环境做出反应的机制。光照在它上面，它的化学反应就会将碳和矿物质转化为糖和氧气。

再来看动物。行为主义者已经证明，动物的行为完全处于刺激-反应的范畴之内。我们或许喜欢这种观点，或许不喜欢，或许同意，或许不同意，但这一事实依然存在。看起来猫似乎在选择是否走进卧室，但实际上它只是在对刺激做出反应。<font color=red>植物和动物在这方面唯一的区别是，动物有一套更复杂的反应机制，它能够区分不同类型的刺激</font>。例如，宠物通常能够区分它认识的人和它不认识的人，并且能够以各种不同的方式做出相应的反应。<font color=red>动物的刺激-反应比植物丰富得多，但本质是一样的</font>。

现在，让我们上升到人类的层次。人类也是一个刺激-反应机制，但要复杂得多。人类的机制能够区分成千上万种不同类型的刺激，其反应范围极为广泛且丰富。

但这或许还不是人类和动物机制之间最重要的区别。或许最重要的区别是，<font color=red>我们人类有一个旁白</font>——一个伴随的声音，它把我们所有的反应都加以解释、证明、合理化。这个**心理旁白**是刺激-反应系统不可分割的一部分，但它却产生了“我”的概念，进而产生了这个“我”在引导自己、这个“我”在选择和决定的概念。

如果把一个台球从悬崖上扔下去，它就会落下。如果把一个动物从悬崖上扔下去，它会落下，而且它的机体在下落过程中会产生恐惧的情绪。如果你或我被从悬崖上扔下去，我们也会落下，我们的反应会包括一系列的情绪，比如恐惧、愤怒、后悔等。然而，除此之外，还会有一些别的东西——会有一个旁白，一路讲述我们被扔下去的原因、正在发生的事情、将要发生的事情等等。所有这些都是反应机制的一部分。

使我们很难把人类看作完全的刺激-反应机制的一个原因是，这个机制的反应范围包括了改变其对未来刺激的反应的能力。<font color=red>我们人类的一个反应就是改变我们未来的反应。这种极其复杂的反应看起来像是“选择”，尽管它仍然是刺激-反应</font>。

另一个障眼法是，人类机制的反应常常是不可预测的——仅仅是因为我们太复杂了。人类机制极其复杂，以至于我们常常无法预测反应会是什么，这种不可预测性被当作选择和控制的进一步证据。

**一方面说心完全是一个刺激-反应机制，另一方面又说心创造了它自己对现实的版本，这看起来像是一个悖论。但仔细看看，我们会发现这两个说法实际上说的是同一件事。**

心对环境中的刺激做出反应，<font color=red>而它的一部分反应就是贴标签、分类、评判、评价</font>。基于此，它渴望某些东西，渴望避免其他东西。然后，它会根据环境是否提供它所渴望的东西而感受到快乐或痛苦。但它渴望什么，以及它对得到的东西的反应，完全是它自身编程的函数。因此，<font color=red>它在某一时刻感受到的快乐或痛苦，取决于它自身的刺激-反应条件反射，而不是环境所提供的东西</font>。

换句话说，<font color=red>**心通过创造它自己对现实的版本来对现实做出反应**</font>。那匹马其实并不好。樱桃其实比甜瓜更好吃。我做那件事其实是正当的。等等。这些说法都是对现实的版本，每一个都是由心完全创造出来的。

心完全是一个刺激-反应机制，同时它又完全负责它对现实的体验。而且，不仅心是刺激-反应的，环境也是；一切都是刺激-反应。心试图掌控一切，而实际上根本没有什么独立的掌控。**环境的所有部分，包括心作为其中的一部分，都在做出反应**。早在行为主义者出现之前，佛陀就将这称为“缘起性空”。




## 第九章
另一种看待心的方式，是将心视为一台极其复杂的计算机。计算机的组成部分有哪些呢？计算机有输入端口，数据由此进入并被处理。它有输出端口，处理后的数据由此输出到环境中。它有一个中央处理单元（CPU），数据在此被处理。还有存储单元，用于存储数据和程序。

那么，什么是程序？程序不过是一系列指令，供CPU执行……先做这个，再做那个，然后再做这个……如此这般。**每条指令都很简单，但因为计算机每秒可以执行数百万条这样的指令，最终结果看起来和确实是极其复杂的**。

在计算机的程序中，有一个主程序——一份关于哪些程序将被执行、以何种顺序以及在何种情况下执行的指令清单。值得注意的是，主程序和其他程序一样，只是一个程序。它没有任何自主决定或自我引导的特性。它根据情况——刺激——按照指令做出反应。结果可能非常精细，但仍然是纯粹的刺激-反应。

现在，将心与这台计算机相比较。心的输入是五种感官。它的输出是思想、情感、面部表情、姿势、行为等……我们全部的呈现，无论是内在的还是外在的。<font color=red>我们可以将所有的输出称为“磁带”。刺激进入，心对其进行处理，并给出一个反应，一个磁带</font>。这个磁带可能是愤怒，可能是微笑，可能是关于天气的一个想法，可能是去上班。心所做的一切，无论是精神上的还是身体上的，都是磁带。

心当然有存储单元，用于存储各种数据和程序。而<font color=red>心还有一个执行子程序，根据其中的指令，决定在任何特定时刻将运行哪个程序，从而决定将呈现哪一盘磁带</font>。

<font color=red>这个主程序只关乎一件事——生存</font>。每一刻，执行子程序都会将舞台中心让给那个根据其指令最能确保生存的子程序。生存可能看起来像是躺在沙滩上晒太阳，可能看起来像是完成家庭作业，也可能看起来像是嫉妒。**磁带将是那一刻在考虑所有因素后，似乎最能优化生存的东西**。

```
getting a tan 晒成棕褐色
```

而生存这件事，有时会呈现出奇怪的形式。假设有人扇了我们一耳光。<font color=red>心会在其存储单元中搜索一个看起来相似的早期情境</font>。假设它找到了一个早期事件，有人打了我们，我们晕了过去——但我们活了下来。它从存储中取出那个程序并运行。

现在，在当下，挨打之后，我们晕了过去。对这颗心来说，这看起来最像生存。对另一个有着不同经历的心来说，生存可能呈现为愤怒、安抚、眼泪或其他形式。但<font color=red>对这颗心在这一情境中</font>，生存看起来最像晕倒。所以它就这么做了。

```
propitiation 安抚，平息
```

但心不止于此。它不仅会在这种特定情境下通过晕倒来做出反应，而且会倾向于一次又一次地设置情境，让我们有机会晕倒并失去意识。毕竟，我们晕倒时确实活了下来，不是吗？所以这颗心会试图创造让我们能够晕倒的情境。

如果我们观察自己，可以看到我们在生活中一次又一次地创造出某些模式。总是遇到不负责任的员工的老板。总是因为不可避免的情况而迟到的男人或女人。总是喜欢新工作，直到逐渐发现同事对他不公平的人。可能的模式是无穷无尽的。

心从反复设置这样的情境中获得了回报；<font color=red>它得以生存，它得以证明自己的观点是正确的</font>。员工确实不负责任。情况确实迫使我迟到。我的同事确实不公平。对心来说，这就是生存。而这一切都是刺激-反应，一切都是自动化的机械行为。

将心视为计算机（在其目前的初级形态中）传达了心的机械性和自动性，但并未完全体现其本质。<font color=red>因为心远比当今任何计算机都要精细</font>。例如，如前面所说，<font color=red>心的部分程序能够改变其对未来刺激的反应</font>。

这种特性并非心所独有，但在当今地球上，心以一种独特的方式拥有它。这是一种非常复杂的刺激-反应形式。这些程序的改变被称为“改进”，当它们是有意识的时候，被心视为其自主选择和独立本质的证据。

而这是这台计算机、这颗心的一个非常有趣的特性。它的一部分程序是认为自己是自我引导的，认为自己是一个“我”，认为自己是一个独立的实体，能够控制自己并在多种选择中做出决定。而这一切都是幻象。<font color=red>并没有真正的控制，也没有真正的选择。没有中心，没有“我”。只有刺激-反应，自动化的程序</font>。

如果我们拆解这台计算机-心，永远不会找到这个“我”，永远不会找到这种自我选择的本质，因为它是不存在的。这在原则上与拆解一辆汽车并无不同。如果我们把汽车的所有部件都拆开，就什么都不会剩下；除了部件之外，没有“汽车”的本质。同样，如果我们把心的所有自动化程序都拿走，就不会剩下任何心，也不会剩下任何“我”。因为它根本就不存在。




## 第十章
然而，正是因为这种<font color=red>“我”的感觉</font>，才会产生各种奇怪的现象。<font color=red>既然有一个“我”，就必须试图让这个“我”生存下去</font>。这个实际上不存在的独立“我”，试图找到维持其存在的方式。这个实际上什么也控制不了的“控制者”，试图找到维持和增强其控制的方法。**难怪心如此忙碌；它有一个不可能解决的问题要解决！**

<font color=red>实际上，唯一的问题就是“我”本身</font>，但心却看不到这一点。<font color=red>心本身才是唯一的问题</font>，这就是为什么心无法解决它自己的问题。

于是，整个游戏就开始了。心在其挣扎和奋斗中，在其活动和努力中，试图解决一个无法解决的问题。它忙于生存和安全的问题，向未来伸展，从过去做出反应，<font color=red>它永远无法在此时此地。它永远无法放下，永远无法完全活在当下，因为一旦它做到，它就不存在了</font>。

心从环境中收集权力、金钱、地位、盟友、爱人、财物、答案和认同，徒劳地试图解决它的问题。它将自己的故事投射到现实中，以至于它看不到现实，然后又思考现实应该如何被改变。心试图改进、改变、变得更好、变得不同，但归根结底，游戏还是一样的。

只要深入地看透这个幻象就行。心是活动，心是思想。心是解决问题、运行程序、朝着目标奋斗。它都是运动。<font color=red>心是忙碌；忙碌就是心</font>。既然心本身是生命中唯一的问题，这意味着<font color=red>心的运动才是实际的问题</font>。

进一步说，既然运动就是心，<font color=red>任何运动或行动都会加剧问题，而不是解决问题</font>。的确，正是这种运动或行动，**才是问题所在**。

如果我们仔细观察，就会发现，最终我们所有试图改进、改变、变得不同或更好的尝试，都是问题的一部分。谁在试图变得更好？是心。试图变得更好或不同，只不过是维持心的运动，从而维持心本身的一种方式。

在试图改变或变得不同时，是谁在尝试？是心。这种努力本身就是问题，就是心。它延续了生命中唯一的痛苦，那就是<font color=red>希望事物与此时此刻的实际情况不同</font>。

也就是说，<font color=red>我们生活中所认为的解决问题的办法，实际上就是问题本身</font>。我们为追求幸福所做的一切努力，正是让我们深陷痛苦的原因。我们为改善事物所做的一切，正是让事物保持现状的原因。

观察一下。你会发现，心的运动——它的欲望、分别、努力、挣扎——才是唯一的问题。除此之外，别无问题。

心创造了它自己对现实的版本，然后把它当作了现实本身。发现这个“现实”不够好，它就试图去改变事物，却没有看到问题不在于现实，而在于它自己创造的那个版本。<font color=red>现实本身从来不是问题；只有我们关于现实的故事才是问题</font>。

```
???
```

心为了给自己找点事做，从现实中创造出问题来，因为正是这种“做事”的行为维持了心的存在。除了心本身的这种渴望之外，别无问题。

如果心是问题，那么为什么不采取行动来消除、改变或熄灭心呢？只要看到这个问题本身就来自心。试图熄灭心的，会是谁？是心。试图改变心的，会是谁？是心。

<font color=red>心现在就在做这件事。它试图改进、改变，让事情变得不同、变得更好</font>。所有这些或许可以暂时缓解问题，让我们从问题中分心，或者更好地适应问题，但它无法消除或解决这个问题。它怎么可能做到呢？所有这些努力本身就是问题。

正如拜伦·凯蒂所说，我们希望事物与实际情况不同，这种欲望就是我们生活中的痛苦。所有欲望都是对此时此地所没有的东西的渴望。欲望本身就是痛苦，因为它阻止我们体验此时此刻的完美和足够。

因此，我们对生活中获得满足的渴望，正是让生活无法令人满意的原因。我们想要改变世界，让它更符合我们的期望，这种渴望正是让世界在我们眼中无法令人满意的根源。我们想要让事情变得完美，这种渴望正是让事情无法完美的原因。

有可能深刻地看到，什么都做不了。<font color=red>我们无法采取任何行动来解决这种情况，也无法从中逃脱</font>，因为任何行动都只是维持现状的另一种方式。

没有办法摆脱心，因为“我们”就是心，我们所认为的自己的任何部分，都没有被排除在外。认为“你”作为一个独立的实体存在，这个想法本身就是生命的问题；那么，“你”又怎么能解决这个问题呢？




## 第十一章
那么，你或许会问，为何不干脆放手呢？为何不接受一切如其所是呢？且慢，这不过是心的另一种自我保全的方式罢了。是谁在决定放手？是谁在决定接受一切？是心。掌控者怎能不试图掌控？成就者怎能不试图成就？改进者怎能不试图改进？这就好比让鼻子不再是鼻子。

<font color=red>心无法真正放手，也无法真正接受一切</font>，因为试图如此做的行为本身，就是在延续心的存在，延续那个“不接受者”。当然，我们可以假装接受，可以让自己相信我们接受了一切，但这不过是自欺欺人罢了。在深层，那个“我”的坚固性仍在被强化。

那么，其他的解决办法呢？去爱每一个人。去为他人服务。去寻求神或觉悟。或者干脆什么都不在乎。但仔细看看。<font color=red>决定去爱每一个人，也不过是另一种磁带</font>。是谁在决定去爱？是心。而**决定去爱或试图去爱，是一种误导的努力，因为真正的爱与试图变得有爱毫无关系**。

爱只是发生了；它是毫不费力且不由自主的。它是一种坠落；它自行发生。无法强迫它。

试图去爱，是心的行为。它是虚假的，与爱本身相距甚远。

那么，或许我们会决定忘掉自己，去为他人服务。但我们连自己都无法服务，又怎能真正为他人服务呢？<font color=red>若我们自己的池塘之水仍浑浊，又怎能期望去澄清他人的池塘呢</font>？看似美好的事，或许会有糟糕的结果。认为自己在做好事，这是心的想法；它强化了构成心的幻象。

并不是说为他人服务不好。但当它真正发生时，就像爱一样——不由自主，毫不费力。而且没有“我在为他人服务”的想法，没有关于它的决定。它只是发生了。

或许，我们会去寻求神或觉悟。但谁在寻求呢？是的，是心。去寻求神或觉悟或转变或任何东西，不过是心延续自身、保持其运动的另一种方式。

<font color=red>寻求金钱、权力、享乐和寻求神圣，看起来或许大不相同，但它们的本质是一样的。仍然是在寻求。仍然是试图去到我们所在之处之外的地方。仍然是心试图超越心。努力就是心。解决之道就是障碍</font>。

一个笑话：我们如何找到神？她正等着我们回家，而我们却找不到她，因为我们正忙着去寻找她。

还有最终的解决办法——干脆什么都不在乎，干脆什么都不做。但这并没有改变什么，因为深层的痛苦仍在。是谁在选择不在乎呢？是的，是心。选择不在乎，就是延续选择者，就是延续这个虚幻的“我”。这是同样的游戏，问题仍在。<font color=red>假装它不存在，不过是问题延续自身的一种方式</font>。

心是问题，但仔细看看，我们会发现，我们无法逃脱它。因为所有的逃避尝试都是心，都是问题。甚至决定不去逃避，也是一种逃避的尝试，因为这样的决定延续了有决定者的幻象。所有的到达尝试，都是无法到达的方式。<font color=red>所有的出路，最终都回到原点</font>。这就好比把一面镜子对着另一面镜子——无限的倒影，无边无际，永无止境。

一切的一切，都是心延续自身的素材。没有任何活动不能服务于心的目的，因为活动本身就是心。所有选择、挣扎、寻求目标和控制的努力，都是心。反之，所有不选择、不挣扎、不寻求目标和不控制的努力，也是心。这一切，都是心。

所有的念头、感受、态度、观点、感觉、立场、行为、故事、呈现、反应——这一切，所有的一切，都在延续心，就是心。没有任何东西被排除在外。关于我们的一切，都是问题的一部分。<font color=red>“我们”自己，就是问题</font>。

**如果“你”和“我”就是我们生命中的问题，那么这个问题如何解决呢？无法解决。那么我们如何摆脱这个虚构的“你”和“我”呢？我们无法摆脱；这就是“我们”**。那么我们如何改善我们的处境呢？我们无法改善。当然，我们可以欺骗自己，但在最深层，没有任何办法可以改善。

只要看到，我们所有的解决办法都是问题，我们所有的逃避都是囚禁，我们所有的变好都是疾病。进一步看到，我们必须试图解决它、逃避它、改善它，因为这是心的本性，这就是它所做的，这就是“我们”。它是完全无法解决的。我们所有的解决办法和非解决办法，都是障碍。

问题：如果这一切都是真的，那么该怎么办呢？

回答：**什么也不做**，因为什么都做不了。

问题：如果什么都做不了，那么我们接下来该去哪里呢？

回答：**哪里也不去**。

问题：那么这一切的目的是什么呢？

回答：没有任何目的。

心认为一切必须有个目的，否则又有什么目的呢？这本身也是问题的一部分。心认为这些话语必须有个目的，但实际上它们没有任何目的。这些话语不过是一些概念、结构、盒子——毫无重要性。

<font color=red>因此，这一切并没有什么“真实”的东西。这里所用的概念，在任何意义上都不是真实的。或许暂时有用，但并不真实。如果心执着于它们，那不过是延续自身、延续那个独立的“你”和“我”的另一种方式罢了</font>。

事实上，逻辑学家会指出，这些概念包含了诸多矛盾。这并不重要。还会更多；它本该如此。而且，它们很有趣。

所有这些话语——过去、未来，以及这句话本身——**不过是创造一个超越概念的某种东西能够发生的契机**。这或许不会立刻发生，或许要等上数月甚至数年，但这并不重要，因为无论如何它都无法被催促或强迫。也无法被延缓。

```
words are just devices to create a situation where something other than concepts can happen.
```

说到底——你觉得这个笑话好玩吗？——说到底，这些话语不过是沙滩上的玩耍，是玩具的来回传递，是在潮湿的沙子里建造的城堡。它们根本没有任何目的。看清这个目的吧。



## 第十二章
<font color=red>我们人类所面临的中心困境，我们生命中的中心问题，无法在问题被提出的那个层面上得到解决。这是一个非凡的问题，因为所有试图解决它的尝试，本身就构成了问题本身。每一次试图改变它、改善它、压抑它、解决它的努力——只会使问题加深</font>。这就好比一个人陷入了流沙，他每一次努力挣脱，只会让自己越陷越深。

问题是什么？问题是心是一个解决问题的机制，却被自身生存的问题所困扰。似乎这个问题是心所继承的。似乎心发现自己独自一人，与一个在最好情况下显得漠不关心、在最坏情况下显得公然敌对的世界分离。但事实并非如此。**心创造了它自己的问题——然后又花费精力试图解决它自己创造的问题**。

当然，既然问题是幻象，它就无法被解决。作为掌控者、选择者、命运引导者的心并不存在——存在的只是刺激-反应。如果<font color=red>作为掌控者的心不存在</font>，它又如何能生存呢？通过伪装；通过不看到它不存在。

心是一场魔术表演，是用镜子玩的把戏，是让不存在的东西看起来存在的魔术师。你看到盒子里的女人被锯成两半，但她并没有被锯成两半；有些东西是虚构的。这就像是心。不存在的心-魔术师通过解决它生存问题的花招来生存。

```
sleight-of-hand 花招，戏法。
```

如果我们仔细观察我们的生活，我们会发现它是关于生存的。<font color=red>心通过问题本身来生存</font>；解决问题的尝试就是心。如果心的奋斗消失，心本身也会消失。

心愿意花费一整个生命试图维持这个障眼法——试图安排事情，让不存在的东西能够生存。它愿意用一整个生命来承受这种荒谬挣扎的痛苦。

而且，它不仅愿意这样做，而且还必须这样做；这是它的本性。心——你和我——会在踏入坟墓的那一刻之前，上演这场喜剧悲剧。心别无选择；它必须这样做。它除了做魔术师之外，什么都做不了——而它是最终的魔术师，因为它的把戏是魔术师本人看起来存在，但实际上并不存在。

所以，这个问题无法以任何方式得到解决，因为所有试图解决它的努力本身就是问题。<font color=red>问题只能被超越，但这种超越并不是任何一种行动。什么也没有做</font>。什么也没有被改善或改变，因为在最深层，没有任何改善或改变是可能的。而是一种觉知、一种看见的升起，然后问题就不再被体验为问题了。



# 实相
Since it is no longer experienced as a problem, the problem can be said to have disappeared. Nothing has changed, the situation remains the same, but the problem has vanished.

In fact there is not now and <font color=red>there has never been any problem in life — other than the magic-show, the mind’s interpretations and stories about what’s happening</font>.

To actually see this is to have transcended the problem of mind. And when that happens **the problem of life becomes like the favorite toy of a child when the child has grown up —it’s simply left behind.** The toy is still there in the closet and nothing has changed about it. But now it’s no longer relevant. It has been transcended.

This transcendence, of course, is not a doingness of any kind. It’s nothing that the mind does, nothing that “you” and“I” do. **Transcendence is not accomplished by the mind at all**. Rather, it is the mind itself that is transcended. “You” and “I”are transcended.

But how in the world is this done? Because remember,there is no way out for the mind, no way out for “you” and “I.”All of our attempts to change our life in any way merely keep it fundamentally the way it is. So how does this transcendence arise?

Consider the following: Imagine a caterpillar which creates a goal of becoming a butterfly. It spends its time imagining ways to do so, trying this method and that method, but nothing seems to work. Because no matter how hard it tries to be a butterfly, it still stays a caterpillar.

It may be an “improved” or “better” caterpillar but its fundamental essence is still caterpillarness.

Now imagine for a moment that our caterpillar could think. If it could, it could not actually even conceive of being a butterfly because its only experience is of being a caterpillar.So if it thinks of becoming a butterfly it's actually thinking of being a better caterpillar.

Being a butterfly is literally unthinkable. Therefore our caterpillar’s attempts to become a butterfly are manifested as attempts to improve itself as a caterpillar. Futile. How does our caterpillar become a butterfly?

The thing to notice is that nothing the caterpillar does causes it to transmute into a butterfly. **Nature handles the problem, the caterpillar doesn’t have to.** All it has to do is be a caterpillar — which it already is — and the transmutation then happens by itself.

The key is being a caterpillar. If the caterpillar is busy trying to become a butterfly or a better caterpillar it is not simply being a caterpillar. **Let it just be a caterpillar — then the butterfly part will take care of itself.**




## Chapter Thirteen
In the case of a caterpillar that’s no problem because a caterpillar has no mind, it has no notion of itself as a chooseror self-guider. But in our case what will we do? We are the mind, everything we’ve ever thought of ourselves as being is the mind. If the mind decides to “be the way it is,” that is just another decision by the mind, it’s the mind surviving. And the mind can never be herenow, can never simply be the way it is. No, **it’s very busy trying to get somewhere**. So how is this paradox resolved?

To answer that question we must introduce <font color=red>the notion of being or the true self</font>. It is who we really are, but it is not“you” or “I.” It has nothing to do with who or what we think we are. It has nothing to do with the mind, nothing to do with our tapes, models, programs, voice-overs, thoughts, emotions,sensations, stories, actions, presentations, metaphysics or anything else about “you” or “I.” No, **it’s who we really are. And it’s beyond the world of stimulus-response.**

**<font color=red>The true self is like an empty blue sky — vast, silent,unchanging. It’s pure consciousness, pure existence. It has no form, and it doesn't look like anything. It is reality, but has nothing to do with the mind’s stories of reality.</font>**

It is truth, but has nothing to do with concepts or words. It is beauty itself, but a beauty beyond form or image.It is bliss, but it has nothing to do with what is normally thought of as happiness because it has no cause. It is peace,stillness, silence, but it has nothing to do with what normally is thought of as relaxation in human life.

No formulations of any kind can really describe being,the self, the existence. <font color=red>It is emptiness, nothing, the absence of anything</font>. It is unsayable, unthinkable, not reachable by any conceptualization. That is, we can conceptualize it but the conceptualization is just nonsense because it has nothing todo with existence or being itself. **Being is unlimited and words are limited — the gap is more or less unbridgeable**. Thus all words and concepts about it are fundamentally false, because <font color=red>words come from a context of exclusion and existence is not that way</font>.

Lets look directly. In order for any conceptualization at all to be formed something must be excluded; otherwise we have the totality, the whole, but no concept. In order to form the concept of ‘pencil” we must exclude that which is “not-pencil.” In order to form the concept of “red” we must exclude that which is not-red.”This is why no mental formulation, no conceptual system no matter how subtle or sublime can be the truth. <font color=red>Because concepts are ultimately grounded in limitation,exclusion, logic — and truth is unlimited, non-exclusive and, to the mind, illogical</font>.

What is truth? Truth is a sunset, truth is rain on the streets, truth is percolating coffee. It is whole. Truth is like a hologram in that each part of it contains the totality. Truth is not a sum of the parts and no amount of explanation can ever reach it; **it simply is what it is**.

**What is truth? Truth is a rose — not the word “rose” nor any theory about roses but purely a rose itself.** We can experience a rose, we can experience reality, we can experience truth,but <font color=red>as soon as we try to put it into words we distort it</font>. We could write a million words about experiencing a rose on a warm spring evening but they would not even come close to the experience itself.

To really see this is to understand, as Osho often said,that ignorance is so vast that it can never be destroyed. What is water? Science answers that it is H2O, hydrogen and oxygen. What is hydrogen, what is oxygen? Science answers that they are certain configurations of protons and electrons, matter and energy, but these are just new names.

Nobody knows what an electron is, nobody knows what matter is, nobody knows what hydrogen is and nobody knows what water is. We have added a few new labels and categories,but the mystery is still profound, totally impenetrable. Our ignorance is infinite, it can never be overcome. <font color=red>It is not possible to ever really know anything</font>.

This being so, it follows that even the simplest things are basically incommunicable, they can’t actually be accurately talked about. Words immediately distort them. If this is true of water or a rose, how much more true is it of words about being.. .self.. .existence. **The moment we talk about it we fall into error and distortion and falsity.**

Thus when we say that being is truth or bliss or peace it must be remembered that this is the language of poetry, of metaphor, of indirect allusion. Even the very words “being” or“self” or “existence” are merely labels created by the mind, and we do well not to take them literally.

The apt phrase used in the Buddhist Surangama Sutrais that <font color=red>all words and concepts about existence are “a finger pointing at the moon.”</font> Words can only indicate, suggest; they are not the moon — reality — but only a finger pointing at it.

<font color=red>The mind, however, misses the moon and focuses on the finger</font>. Mind pores over philosophies, theologies, meta-physical systems and then feels that the existence is really such-and-such a way. Mind always misses the point. Even the concepts in this paragraph are just toys in the sandbox.

An interesting true story: A seeker once came to the Zen master Joshu and asked, “What is the Buddha? Who is the Buddha? Where can he be found?” Joshu replied, “Go into the temple. You will find the Buddha there.” Then the man said, “But inside the temple there is only a stone statue. And you know and I know that a stone statue is not the Buddha.”Joshu replied, “You are absolutely right. A stone statue is not the Buddha.”And so the man said, “Then who is the Buddha?” And Joshu replied, “Go into the temple. You will find the Buddha there.”

A curious story. This seeker had seen beyond the symbolism of stone statues, but not beyond other symbolisms. So he assumed that Joshu was talking about external temples.But Joshu had no interest in external temples, he was talking about the temple within. He was saying that **unless we see into the nature of the mind we are lost, we’ll never find out that we're already the Buddha.**

Mind needs excitement; it needs diversion, the chase,the search. It is like a spider constantly spinning and then being caught in its own web. The spinning, the excitement,the activity, the seeking are smokescreens which prevent us from seeing into the nature of all this. **We’ve become like a man searching around the world for the nose on his face. So he can’t see that he already has what he’s looking for.**

Truth is the immediate, the foreground, but we don’t see it because we’re scanning the heavens for it.




## Chapter Fourteen
Mind is enmeshed in symbolism, in stories, and it takes these for reality, for truth. Yet <font color=red>nothing which can be expressed in words or symbols is “true”; neither is it “false.” Rather, it is merely useful or non-useful</font>. 

Science is replete with examples of “truths” which became supplanted. First light was a particle, then a wave; now it’s something of both. First the world was flat, now it is round; someday it may be perceived in some other way. First Newton's laws were “true”; now relativity is considered “true,” and someday it in turn will be supplanted. **No concept or law or symbolic relation is ultimately “true”; it's simply useful or not useful for a limited period.**

Is “The tree is green” true? Certain vibrations are hitting our eyes and we have agreed to label those “green.” A different interpretation of the vibrations we have agreed to label “tree.” When we say “The tree is green” we're simply attaching two labels together; **it may be useful, but there’s nothing true about it.** Conjoining the labels “tree” and “green” has a lot of agreement, but somebody may disagree — to them the tree may be chartreuse.

```
chartreuse [ʃɑːrˈtruːz] 察吐士酒，荨麻酒(一种烈性甜酒，呈绿色或黄色);浅黄色;浅绿色
```

This might seem like an out-of-the-way or irrelevant matter, but it extends into our whole life.Let's say we feel that our girlfriend is boring. To us that’s true, but to someone else it’s false. Let’s say we feel we don’t have enough money. To us that’s true — our desires out-strip what we have. But actually it’s a matter of desires — the mind — rather than money. We’re creating our experience of the sum of money we have.

Similarly, we’re creating our experience of everything whatsoever in our life. It’s all our creation. We create what is good, bad, true, false, right, wrong, desirable and undesirable in our life.

**Existence is none of these categories. It simply is what it is. It is pristine, pure, ever-new. It has no past, no future, it is simply herenow. Then the mind comes in and imposes its tapes and stories upon it. The mind imposes its judgments,evaluations, discriminations, dualities, categories, labels and multiplicities. It boxes up reality and then is caught in its own box. It projects its own movie onto the screen of reality and then lives in the movie. And it’s in deep suffering because it’s off in the past or the future some where.**

Something is wrong, because <font color=red>happiness is the criterion in life</font>. If our path in life is giving us deep bliss, deep abiding joy then it is the right path. But look carefully and let’s ask ourselves truthfully: <font color=red>**How many moments in our life have we experienced such profound rapture and peace that we had no desire for anything more whatsoever? A handful of times?**</font>

If bliss is the criterion — and it is — then we’re missing the mark. What is wrong? We go on fixing things, improving,solving problems — and our situation remains the same.

Seeing this, we begin to look at the root of the problem — the mind itself — instead of the leaves. Once we begin to see direcly into the con game of the mind we’re astonished,stupefied as to why we go on carrying this madman.

```
stupefy [ˈstuːpɪfaɪ] 使惊讶(或惊呆、思维不清、神志不清)
```

For <font color=red>it is us as the self, existence itself, who is carrying the mind</font>. Not the self that we identify with — our thoughts,emotions, attitudes, points of view, etc. — for that is all mind. No, us as existence itself is carrying it.

**Let’s be alert now, for the mind will immediately try to box up “the self,” “the existence.”** Mind will create pictures of what it is, images of what it looks like: Infinite space. White light. Blue light. Darkness. Pure energy. The eternal. And soon. None of these are wrong, and neither are they right. None of these symbols can be taken seriously, for they’re all just play things. They’re only fingers pointing at the moon.

And there are many such symbols, reflecting the attempts of those who have awakened to communicate the incommunicable.

There is the tradition known as the via positive, the positive way, in which existence is given some of the labels we have been using, such as being, the self, reality, the whole, the eternal, the infinite, consciousness, truth. These are not separate aspects of the existence but merely different labels for the same thing. Yet because these positive labels use a descriptive form they are deceiving, they tend to be taken literally.

To get around this tendency some other traditions have followed the via negative , the negative way, in referring to existence. They refer to it by indicating what it is not.

Thus in the Upanishads there’s a famous passage which <font color=red>describes the existence as “not this, not that.”</font> 

```
Upanishads 奥义书
```

Whatever description we use, it is not that. This seems a bit closer. For referring to the existence is akin to describing the color blue to someone born blind: Is it loud? No. Is it soft? No. Is it rough? No. Is it smooth? No. Is it sweet? No. Is it fragrant?No. Is it melodic? No. Saying what it is not is in a sense more accurate than trying to say what it is.

So when the existence is referred to in these traditions it’s given names such as nothingness, emptiness, the void, the abyss. The advantage of such labels is that they don't suggest any particular attribute to which the mind can cling, since all attributes are negated. On the other hand, the mind can take even “nothingness” or “emptiness” literally — so it’s fruitful to remember that even via negative labels are not actually true or accurate.

Still another way of approaching being or existence is to refer to it as oneness or the non-dual or the One. 

When mind looks upon the world it looks through its glasses of discrimination and sees a multiplicity of separate entities — including itself — all struggling for survival. This, however, is just the appearance.

Beneath the surface, existence is a totality; it is One. <font color=red>At this level there is no struggle of any kind because there must be a duality in order for struggle to exist</font>; struggle must be for something or against something. 

But <font color=red>the One is everything; it excludes nothing, desires nothing, seeks nothing, is against nothing</font>. How then can there be a struggle? The existence is playing, it likes to look upon itself from different points of view... different entities. And part of this play or lela is that those points of view which have consciousness imagine themselves to be separate entities.




## Chapter Fifteen
Picture an ocean...waves moving on its surface. Each wave rises up, exists for a while, then falls back into the ocean from whence it came. Now imagine that each wave has the notion that it exists separately. Naturally, each wave is then concerned with survival, with the problem of how to go on existing.

Notice that the problem is unsolvable, because in fact at some point the wave is going to cease to exist. But this is only a problem at the level of wave, where the wave is trying to go on existing separately. The wave is clinging to its separateness,which creates its problem. Notice that at the level of ocean there is no problem, because the ocean is neither coming into existence nor going out of existence. Nor is it trying to survive. It simply is.

Notice too that at no time is the wave actually separate from the ocean. Indeed, even to call it a “wave” separates it in our minds, but in fact there is only the ocean. Even if the wave thinks it is separate, it is not. The attempt to survive perpetuates its sense of separateness, but actually it is never separate.There is only the ocean, evolving and changing its form on the surface, yet remaining always the same.

Actually, the only problem the wave has is that it is trying to solve a problem. <font color=red>The moment it gives up its problem of survival it is at the level of ocean</font>, where there is no problem of any kind. At that level there is only the serenity and bliss of existence itself.

```
及吾无身，吾有何患？
廓然而大公，物来而顺应。
```

**The wave is already the ocean; it doesn't have to achieve anything in order to become the ocean. It already is that. Its only problem is its illusion that it has to achieve something,that it has to get some where, that it has to make its way, that it has to survive. The shift from the level of wave to the level of ocean can come in an instant; it takes no time because nothing has to be changed or achieved. Everything is already in place except for the wave dropping its cherished illusion of being separate.**

But notice that <font color=red>the wave itself cannot drop this illusion of separateness</font>. Separateness is how it conceives of its existence; how can it drop itself? Similarly, the mind feels separate and will always feel separate; that is its nature. Separateness is its very existence; it cannot see through itself.

But <font color=red>if the mind somehow disappears then there is no problem</font>. Then Being, Existence shines forth from that empty vessel, It experiences itself without any impediment from the mind. It was always there. When the mind is gone, Being is.It is there automatically since it was never not there.

```
无名关照
```

An analogy can be used of a lamp encased in mud. The light is there but it cannot be seen, cannot be experienced because of the mud blocking it. <font color=red>Remove that mud, and the light that was always there is revealed</font>.

Another analogy is of the sun shining on a cloudy day.If clouds cover the sky then the sun cannot be seen, yet it is still there. This is our situation. Those clouds are thoughts,stories, tapes. Let one cloud be removed and the sun can be seen a little. Let another be removed and the sun can be seen a little more.

The sun is then seen through the gaps, just as Being or Existence is experienced through gaps in the thoughts/tapes of the mind. As more gaps open up and the Mystery is more available, it can be said — in a manner of speaking — that the Self awakens. But the mind itself cannot open up the gaps, as any attempt to do so would be just another tape, just another cloud in the way.

To say that Being or the Self awakens is perhaps to give the impression that there is a separate being or self in each person. But no, <font color=red>only minds are separate</font>; that is why they're an illusion. <font color=red>Being is always One</font>. **Putting it another way, my true self and your true self are the same self. There is only one Self, one Being, one Existence, one Ocean.** In the Upanishads it is said that At man is Brahman — **the individual soul is the Existence, is the totality. There is only the One.**

```
人同此心，心同此理。
```

This is keenly disappointing to the mind, which hopes to survive physical death through the notion of an individual soul or essence which goes to heaven or reincarnates into a new body or whatever. But **heaven and hell and anything we could desire in the after life are all here now**. “The kingdom of heaven is within you,” Jesus said. It is Existence itself which reincarnates into new forms.

**Existence keeps taking new forms and the surface of things keeps changing just as the surface of the ocean is constantly in motion. But underneath, all is changeless, silent,still. Who we really are is vast and open like the sky. Who we really are cannot die because it was never born.**

All aspects of the mind, on the other hand, are merely surface and are destined for annihilation. All the things that we think we are, all of the things which we cling to — our attitudes, emotions, thoughts, memories, patterns, view points —will die as surely as a blooming rose or a wave on the ocean.

All of what we think is important and unique about us is transitory and will fade as quickly as a leaf in autumn. The mind’s problem is not solvable. It is trying to survive and it can not. And meanwhile its efforts and struggles keep it in anguish, which it polishes over with transitory gratifications. This going-through-the-motions, this daily round — eating,sleeping, working, relaxing, improving, all as a means to an end — is what we call life.

So the problem of life can only be transcended. It can never be solved. All of the mind's efforts to solve it, improve it, change it, make it better only deepen the problem. Yet the problem can be transcended. What happens is that Being awakens from a dream, so to speak, and discovers It’s the Ocean and not the wave. 

**The problem in the dream does not need to be solved. Awakening is enough. Then the dream vanishes and the unsolvable problem vanishes with it.**




## Chapter Sixteen

But how is this awakening, this transcendence accomplished? If the mind does not do it, if indeed there is no doing involved, then how does it happen? To answer this question,let us look at the mind from still another perspective:
At each moment the mind is running its stimulus-response programs — tapes, thoughts, stories. These programs are used to paint reality, to project on the screen of Existence the version of reality that the mind wants to see. In order to see these tapes as reality it is necessary not to see them as tapes — that is, it is necessary not to notice them as generated within the mechanism. The tapes must be seen as being out there; they must be seen as the real world, as reality, as “the way things really are.”

An analogy of watching a movie can be used. <font color=red>If we get really engrossed in watching the story on the screen we may forget that it’s not real</font>. We’re feeling anxiety or hope, tears or joy, when suddenly the projector breaks down and the screen goes dark. And then we remember that it’s only a movie, that it’s not real.

Similarly, if with one of **the mind’s tapes** or programs we suddenly <font color=red>remember that it’s only a tape</font>, if we suddenly notice it as a tape — a beautiful tape or an ugly tape, but still only a tape — then the movie is over for that moment. The program is exposed as merely a program; the screen has gone dark, so to speak.

In that moment we no longer see the tape as reality because we are seeing it as merely a tape, as merely a program.Since **the purpose of a tape is to present itself as reality**, <font color=red>the instant its lack of reality is exposed the program simply stops running</font>. The tape disappears. The program, the tape, the act,the number, the thought — whatever we want to call it — just goes back to where it came from. **In that instant of awareness there is no mind anymore; there is only Being.**

Who or what does the noticing? The mind cannot do it because the mind is inescapably stuck in its dreams, in its manufactured version of reality. <font color=red>Only the Self, only the Being can be aware</font>. It is awareness. The moment the Self notices that the particular tape running at that moment is simply a tape and not reality, the moment the Self notices the program as a program — in that moment the program that was running simply disappears. In that moment there is only the Self, there is no mind. Metaphorically speaking, in that moment the Self has awakened, **the wave has discovered it is the Ocean**.

But in the next moment another tape will be called up and run as a response to stimuli from the environment. In this metaphor, if the Self identifies with this tape and sees it as reality, then, so to speak, the Self is caught once more; then the Being has been sucked into the illusion once again. Again It has fallen asleep. Once more It has become identified with the mind, with the automatic stimulus-response mechanism. Now the survival programming of the mechanism is in the driver's seat.

Then at some point another moment comes when the Self notices a program as a program, **notices a tape as simply a projected version of Reality itself**. The tape vanishes; it can no longer present itself as real. In that instant the Self can be said to be awakened once more.

So it goes, back and forth. Self awakens from its long slumber for a moment, then goes back to sleep again. And again It awakens, only to return to sleep once more. In the beginning the Self awakens only fitfully. It is like some one engrossed in a vivid dream trying to remember that it is only a dream — and the moment she does, of course, the dream is no longer there. It is like someone in a deep hallucination trying to remember that the hallucination is not real.

```
hallucination  [həˌluːsɪˈneɪʃn]  幻觉;幻视，幻听(尤指生病或毒品所致);幻视(或幻听)到的东西;幻象
```

In the beginning this process seems difficult because the moments of awareness are *few and far between*. But that is just the appearance. The moment of awareness itself is not difficult because awareness is not a doingness of any kind. <font color=red>The Self does not exist in time or space</font>; it is not engaged in any activity, striving or effort. So **awareness is not something that is done; it simply is. It simply happens.**

```
few and far between 稀少的;罕见的
```

If awareness of a tape is an effort then it is not awareness, it is something being done by the mind. For the mind is all about effort and struggle and striving; the mind can never be effortless since it is always in one way or another trying to be somewhere other than where it is.

Awareness, not being of the mind, is effortless. It takes place outside of the whole stimulus-response mechanism, and isn’t an activity. <font color=red>It is not active, but passive</font>.

The difference can be seen in a metaphor suggested by Osho. Imagine waiting in a train station where we are to meet our lover. We actively watch the doors; we are looking for a particular face, our lover's face. We are not interested in other faces. This is active awareness. This is mind. **Mind is looking for a result; it is looking for something in particular.**

Now imagine sitting by the side of a river in autumn,watching the leaves on the river float by. As each leaf passes by, it is **noticed without effort.** No leaf is more important than any other, yet no leaf passes by without being noticed. There is no concern for results, there is no end in view. There is just a choiceless, silent watching. **This is passive awareness. This is awareness by the Self; indeed, it is the Self. Each leaf is simply noticed and let go; there is no concern about it.**

This is what one does with one's tapes, programs,thoughts, feelings, sensations, models, acts and demands. **We simply notice whatever comes up, whatever is running, with bare attention. Nothing is added; no judgment, no evaluation,no feeling that it’s good or bad, or that it should or shouldn't be there.**

**We simply allow what is there to be there, and notice it without encouragement or condemnation. Adding encouragement, condemnation, judgment, evaluation, or anything else would be doing something with the tape/story, and pure awareness is a non-doingness.**

```
condemnation [ˌkɑːndemˈneɪʃn] 谴责;指责
```

We allow each leaf — each tape — to come into our awareness without desire or avoidance, and we allow it to leave without clinging or pushing. There are no preferences. Each thought is allowed to come in and it’s allowed to go. It is simply noticed without adding anything. **And if the mind does add something to it, then the addition is also simply noticed.**

**It’s like noticing waves on the sea.** Each wave comes up out of the depths, is noticed and allowed to be, and then disappears back into the ocean from which it came. **It is like watching clouds in the sky.** Each cloud appears, moves across the sky, then disappears. There is no reason for the cloud to be there; it just happens to be there. And while it is there it is silently watched. We watch the thoughts of the mind in just the way that we would watch clouds pass across the sky.




## Chapter Seventeen
Depending on the tradition this is called awareness or witnessing or mindfulness. Sometimes it is referred to as bare attention or self-remembering. The name doesn't matter, for the same phenomenon underlies the different names. **It is a deep allowing. It’s a deep let-go. It is a deep willingness for whatever exists to exist. It is a deep loving of whatever is there, and choosing it to be the way it is. It’s a deep gratitude and celebration of what is. It’s a deep observation of what exists without attachment or avoidance.**

There are two main branches on this tree. The first is about beginning where we are — in our daily life. For instance,if we’re taking a shower we’re usually not herenow with it; we’re not aware of the loveliness of the water falling on us. Instead, we’re thinking of various things, wondering about this and that, getting ready for work or whatever. Usually,we’re not just taking a shower when we're taking a shower.

Using awareness in daily life would mean, for instance,noticing the stories/tapes that are running as we’re taking the shower. It would mean noticing what is getting in the way of just being there with the shower. As we <font color=red>notice the tapes</font>, we neither reject them nor encourage them.

```
勿忘勿助
```

We do nothing with them. Its simply a noticing that they are tapes, that the mind is in motion. One accepts them,allows them, chooses them to be there, but not as an active thing. Rather, the acceptance is implicit in the awareness it-self. As we notice the tapes as just tapes, the motion as just motion, the tapes become more flimsy — and then we're just taking a shower, nothing else.

When we see a story as reality instead of as a story, its as if we've become fascinated by one of the leaves in the stream and are now following it as it moves downstream. **Our attention is caught; we're clinging**. Then we're living in the version of reality produced by taking that thought as reality.Then **we miss reality itself by clinging to something limited.** Conversely, as we simply watch each tape with detachment as it comes in and goes out, with no preferences, then we arrive at <font color=red>the door way of the spiritual — the present moment</font>.

When Buddha talks about attachment being the cause of suffering, an image can arise of attachment to objects or people. And indeed we do get attached to people and objects. But we do so because of the stories we tell ourselves.

```
attachment = 执
```

<font color=red>We cannot be attached to people or objects without being attached to our story about them</font>. That is the real attachment that the Buddha was talking about. And that clinging means seeing that belief or story as reality. If there is no "reality” in the perception of a tape/story then there will be no attachment to it either. Then it will be just another belief or story and will be seen as such. Divested of the quality of being "true" and "real" it ceases to engage us.

Thus attachment to a person or object actually consists of the moment-to-moment clinging that occurs when there is a story about it. And the interactions and circumstances of daily life tend to bring up exactly those tapes that most need to be noticed. So **using mindfulness moment-to-moment in everyday situations is a fast way to bring awareness to deep-seated attachments**.

```
mindfulness 正念减压法
```

But also, there is great value in sitting silently, free for a period of the hustling and bustling of the daily routine, so that one can observe without distraction the tapes that *bubble up out of the depths of* one's mind. <font color=red>In the silence of just sitting still, we can more easily become aware of the movement of the mind</font>. 

```
hustling and bustling 熙熙攘攘
```

Then, as the stories gradually become more flimsy, the mind also becomes more flimsy since the mind is nothing other than its stories. Then <font color=red>Reality starts to move through us a little more</font>.

These two approaches complement each other well. It’s helpful to use awareness in periods of silence as well as in one's daily routine. When used together they open a common door — the gradual disappearance of the mind.

In Zen they call this disappearance no-mind. In this state all dualities, all models, all beliefs, concepts, limitations,demands, exclusions, positions and versions of reality have been transcended, for there is no mind to sustain them. In the resulting emptiness, Existence can play its Melody through us more and more, like Breath through a hollow flute.

```
no-mind 无念
```




## Chapter Eighteen
When we look closely at the stories we give meaning to,the positions we get on, it becomes clear that certain stories or positions recur over and over. There are dominant themes or leitmotifs in the life of each of us, and it’s no accident that each of us creates certain situations, runs certain tapes, gets on certain positions, again and again.

```
leitmotifs [ˈlaɪtmoʊˌtifs] 主旨
```

It’s similar to a post-hypnotic suggestion. Let’s suppose that someone hypnotizes us and implants a post-hypnotic suggestion that whenever he raises an eyebrow we will crave a bowl of soup, but that we won’t remember the suggestion. Now after the hypnotic session we will feel perfectly normal. We and the hypnotist are talking, let's say, when suddenly he raises an eyebrow. Immediately we will desire a bowl of soup,and to justify this desire we will mention something perhaps about it being time for lunch.

```
post-hypnotic 催眠后的
```

Notice that the justification we use has nothing whatever to do with the impulse itself. Our desire for soup is because of the post-hypnotic suggestion. Yet on top of that we will add a soundtrack, a voice-over, a story or rationalization about why we are desiring soup now. That is, we’ll justify our impulse. That’s one of the things the mind does.

More than that, we’ll feel that we’ve chosen now to have a bowl of soup because it’s lunchtime, when in fact we’re acting out a situation which is entirely mechanical for us, which is entirely stimulus-response.

If we spend our life around people who often raise an eyebrow we will find ourself frequendy desiring a bowl of soup. And in each case where we have a bowl of soup <font color=red>we’ll feel that we have chosen to do so, that we’ve made a decision about it</font>.

And in each case our mind will supply a reason as to why we’ve chosen to have a bowl of soup at that moment. And the reason in each case will be entirely irrelevant because our having a bowl of soup is pure stimulus-response — yet we will feel that we are the decider, the controller, the chooser in the situation.

It will become a dominant theme in our life. We’ll become known as a person who especially likes soup and who enjoys a bowl of it in all sorts of different situations. And if someone asks us why we like soup so much we’ll give them some reasons, and those reasons will be completely irrelevant. Yet we will present ourself as — and feel ourself to be — someone who chooses to have this theme of soup in our life because of those reasons. And it will all be an illusion.

Couldn’t any neurosis, compulsion, pattern, obsession,psychosis or character disorder be created in someone by implanting the proper combination of post-hypnotic suggestions? Yes. Why is this important? Because <font color=red>early experiences in life function essentially like post-hypnotic suggestions.</font>

When we're experiencing the shock and pain, physical or emotional, of a deeply perceived threat to survival then whatever “suggestions” are present at that time will be burned into our mind just as if they were post-hypnotic suggestions. And even though forgotten, they will affect us subsequently in just the same way.

For instance, a husband and wife quarrel violently while a young baby girl watches. The husband leaves in a rage, accidentally knocking against the baby, and the wife mutters at his back, “You bastard!” The baby experiences a threat to survival from the violence of the scene and from the loss of her father for a few days.

Yet the mind of the baby notices that it survived. By the logic of the primitive mind, therefore, survival was achieved by a quarrel where daddy left. The “post-hypnotic suggestion” the baby picks up is that people similar to daddy — i.e., tall men with dark hair, let’s say — are bastards, and that one survives by entering into a relationship with one and then causing him to leave. And later in life, that is exactly what this baby-turned-woman will do. And in each case she will have brilliant reasons for causing things to turn out that way. And of course the reasons will look like reality; they will look like the truth.

Absurd? Yes. Nonsensical? Yes. Destructive? Yes. <font color=red>But to the mind, effective for survival? Yes.</font> The mind equates that behavior with survival and will create that situation over and over again in order to “survive.” <font color=red>Look around and we’ll see people (including ourselves) creating recurring patterns again and again in their lives.</font>

These patterns in our lives are absolutely non-nurturing and yet we are all frozen in them, clinging to them — and clinging to all our brilliant reasons as to why our life keeps turning out this way or that way.

Watch the recurring themes and patterns that run our lives: some of us make our lives about trying very hard but never quite making it. Some of us are habitual victims of one thing or another. Some of us become chronic complainers or bored cynics or righteously indignant crusaders.

```
righteously indignant crusaders 理直气壮的、愤慨的改革者
```

Some of us make our lives about getting others before they get us. Some of us smile a lot while feeling lonely inside. Some of us make our lives about producing guilt in others through self-sacrifice. Some of us make ourselves the central figure in an ever-recurring tragic drama. Some of us use being “on” as a means of not really being with others.

```
central figure 中心人物
```

A list of the different themes and patterns that run our lives in various ways would be virtually infinite. And each one is no different in quality from the post-hypnotic suggestion about having a bowl of soup. Each is mechanical, automatic —and yet accompanied by all sorts of voice-overs, all sorts of reasons and explanations. We get stuck in these patterns,frozen in them, just as if we were to emphasize a few notes on the piano over and over.

The payoff in this automatism is survival, and **survival means being right.** For example, the baby who heard her mother say “You bastard!” as her father left the house is now,as a woman, engaged on an unconscious level in proving that men are bastards. And when through her unwitting behavior each love affair breaks up abruptly and that man leaves her too, she gets to be right again. She gets to feel self-righteous and self-justified. “See? I told you. Men are bastards.”

Since the mind is nothing but this collection of tapes,positions, patterns, programs, points of view — all names for the same thing — <font color=red>getting to be right about them is tantamount to validating the existence of the mind</font>. Since the mind is its points of view, then perpetuating them, running them, being justified about them is the very act of survival itself. **It is identical to perpetuating the “I.**” “You” and “I” survive by running tapes, by getting on positions and being right about them.

Of course, methods exist for improving this situation. Going back into one's past, locating and re-experiencing the incident that burned in a recurring pattern in one's life will cause the pattern to cease running, just as re-experiencing the moment when a post-hypnotic suggestion was implanted will cause that suggestion to cease also. This is *Patanjali's pratiprasov* method, and in the West exists as various forms of regression analysis.

Another method is to consciously focus one's attention upon the complex of attitudes, body sensations, postures,expressions, points of view, conclusions and images associated with a recurring theme or pattern in one's life. In its various aspects, this is the method of psychotherapy, and works to give us some insight into our patterns and thus to lessen their force and power.

These methods are valuable in helping us to adjust to life. But while they can ameliorate some of the problems that we humans create for ourselves, they cannot relieve the deepest suffering of the mind because they don’t involve a deep seeing into the nature of the mind itself, which creates its suffering by saying that its stories mean something.

Even if these methods could deal with all the patterns set up by intense threat-to-survival incidents — very unlikely since there are so many of them — they would still not lead to no-mind, to liberation. Why? Because liberation is not of you and I; it is from you and I.




## Chapter Nineteen
All methods, all devices can be valuable because they have the potential to begin to rouse us from our slumbers,they can create the critical mass where witnessing begins, they can be a door out of the box in which we spend our life. On the other hand, any method, any device can become a trap if we become attached to it, if it becomes one more link on the treadmill of improving, changing, seeking, achieving.. .all the material around which the ego condenses.

```
critical mass 临界质量
```

Anything can be the prison, anything can be the firststep into the eternal, into liberation, and it depends upon our willingness to watch. We become enlightened not by what we do or don't do, but by watching what we do or don’t do. If we cling to a method it cannot help us with the real problem. And <font color=red>what is the real problem? That we’re trying to survive and improve something — our separate selves — which at the deepest level are an illusion, which don’t actually exist</font>.

Only awareness doesn’t feed this doingness of the mind,because only awareness is not an activity and doesn’t keep the mind's motion going. Only awareness is silent, effortless, passive, not of the mind. Only awareness <font color=red>cuts at the root by watching the very nature of mind itself</font>.

For example, let's suppose we're running a tape that men are bastards and thereby creating a situation where our current lover will leave us, making us right again. Good; let’s not change anything. Let’s <font color=red>simply watch this process without encouragement or condemnation or any evaluation at all</font>.

Let’s simply watch as we set up the situation. Let’s watch as we create ourself being right. Let’s watch as we tell ourself that men are bastards. As we watch, these tapes will start losing force, they will start disappearing of their own accord. We don’t need to do anything. Indeed, anything we do is simply another tape.

We just become a witness to our positions, patterns,presentations. <font color=red>We notice them as positions now instead of as reality</font>. We see that our version of reality is being generated internally moment-to-moment by the automatic programs of the mind.

“That bastard!” If we’re running that tape, for example,what’s real for us is that he’s a bastard — until we notice that it’s just a story, a position, an automatic product of the mind. Actually, he just did whatever he did; that is what is. On top of that we add our interpretations, judgments, programs, etc.and project them out there.

We see wrongness out there and want to change it or be mad about it or whatever. But once we see that wrongness —and rightness too — is being manufactured internally by the mind’s survival programming, and that it’s merely the mind dreaming, then the wrongness and the rightness, the labels and interpretations and acts gradually disappear.

Then we can simply be with what’s there — a child, a flower, a tax form, a lover, a sunset. **In that moment there are no obstacles between us and Existence in all Its many forms**.The very obstacles become channels.

Without awareness we suffer even if all is seemingly okay on the surface. There’s nothing wrong in that, but we pay a price. The cost is being frozen in our mechanical series of presentations. The cost is being dead while we’re still alIive,dragging along, acting out programmed dramas.

```
dragging along 拖着，得过且过
```

Dragging along in life is heart-wrenching. For <font color=red>the cost of dragging along is missing the mystery and loveliness of Existence</font>. Existence is knocking, but we’re not at home to answer the door.

Instead we’re off with our stories, dreaming with them,hypnotized by them. We can miss our own life in this way. We can miss the wholeness, the fulfillment, the effortlessness, the bliss that is waiting. We can miss experiencing ourself as the Ocean and not the wave. We can stay entangled in a fight for survival, security, pleasure, rightness.

Let’s become a witness to the mind in our daily life.Let’s become aware. Let’s let everything be grist for the mill. **Let’s observe our thoughts coming and going just as we might observe cars on the street coming and going**. And in addition,<font color=red>using whatever posture allows us to forget the body without becoming sleepy, let’s take some time out each day to just sit quietly with no activity</font>. In the stillness and silence of sitting quietly, the mind will come to seem more and more flimsy,distant. And one day it will simply be gone.

A question: If awareness is not a doingness of any kind,how do we start? How do we get it to begin? <font color=red>Actually its there already, so beginning is really a matter of allowing it to be there</font>. **Its simply an allowing**. It just happens when we’re aware that it will.

**Many things happen which we don’t understand. And there’s no need to understand them**. Let’s watch. How do we eat? By moving our hand with its utensil to our mouth. Yes,but how do we get our hand to move? By contracting the muscles in our arm. Yes, but how do we contract the muscles in our arm? By sending down a nerve impulse from the brain?And how do we do that? **Ultimately, we don't know how we accomplish even a simple thing like eating. We just eat. It just happens.**

When we look deeply we see that everything in our life is like this. Things happen, but at the deepest level we don't know how.

Awareness is the same. It begins by itself, and we won’t understand it. We can just allow it. We just become a witness to our own movement. There are no instructions.



# Opening

## Chapter Twenty
We're always seeking. That might be the best definition of a human being: the seeker. We're looking for ways to survive, to be secure and powerful, to be gratified and fulfilled. As we have seen, the mind normally never stops seeking. It is its very nature.

In sum, <font color=red>each of us has certain stimulus-response programs which are predominant and which determine what can be called our prevalent theme or pattern or racket in life. It is our predominant attitude</font>.

For some of us the habitual response may be anger. For others the habitual tone might be cynicism. Some of us have a life which is about trying very hard. For some the habitual one is grief. Some of us stuff down our emotions and become very monotone. Many other examples could be given.

The tone is not always apparent, but is always there as an undercurrent. Our predominant theme or pattern in life is our mode of survival moment-to-moment, <font color=red>our unconscious method of coping</font>. According to our programming, it is how we seek to survive.

Along with this predominant pattern or survival-mode,each of us has a predominant method or complex of methods for seeking happiness. This is how we feel we can achieve fulfillment, completion, satisfaction. It’s our dream, our search.It’s our path. If the survival-mode is our way of seeking to avoid the stick, then this is our predominant way of seeking the carrot. It’s the rainbow on the horizon for us.

It takes many forms. To some of us, happiness means obtaining enough money — and of course, “enough” is almost always a bit more than what is available. For others, the lure is power. For still others, fame or notoriety. Some dream of achieving a life situation where ever-new sensual experiences can be created. Belief in a movement or cause or way of life is the carrot for some, and the hope is for the triumph of that movement or cause.

Or the path can take a more down-to-earth form. The right degree will make us happy. Fulfillment will be achieved when the perfect lover or soulmate is found.. .or married.. .or remarried. To some of us, the holy grail is good health. To others, the advancement of the arts. To be able to retire. The list is endless.

<font color=red>Our path here is that which we think of as bringing happiness once it is perfectly achieved</font>. Once it is perfectly achieved, we tell ourselves, all seeking will end. It will be enough. Of course, there are always barriers or obstacles to the achievement, otherwise that which is being sought would already be here. So the mind’s thinking runs something like this: “Once I get this, I'll be happy.” “As soon as I get over the hump, I'll relax.” “Once I get past these obstacles, I'll be able to enjoy myself.”

Now the interesting thing is that sometimes we do reach our goal. We achieve what we wanted to achieve. And what happens? We’re gratified for a little while. But then we make an interesting discovery. We discover that our achievement is perhaps not enough after all. We find that we still feel a gnawing dissatisfaction.

And we even see the cause of it. It is because we over-looked something, something that we very much need to be happy. Whatever this something is to us — the right job, the right place to live, the right man or woman, whatever — we now set off to achieve it.

And so the search continues. It has to be so, for that is the nature of mind. What we’ve done is to exchange our old path for a new path. Before, let’s say, what was most important was the spread of the movement we were involved in. Now we know that that was not quite correct. Now, let’s say,we know that the most important thing is to own our own house. And so we have a new path now, a new rainbow-goal to reach.

Each new path starts out as a fragrance, as a game, as something pleasant to pursue. It ends in misery and suffering,as we become more and more attached to our path. Before, we were like a dog chasing its tail. Now once again, we’re chasing our own tail. The only difference is that since the tail is now decorated a little differently we think it’s a different game. As our attachment grows and we whirl around faster we descend further into suffering. We don’t have what we want, or we’re afraid of losing what we have.

<font color=red>If our attachments cause suffering, why do we cling to them? Because all our attachments feel comfortable on the surface. We like our attachments. We get a payoff from them. We get a sense of certainty from them, a sense of comfortable familiarity, a sense of being right. We identify with them.</font>

As the master Adyashanti says, we get a thrill from our desires; that’s why we follow them. <font color=red>**We enjoy the excitement of wanting something; if the excitement of wanting were not there we might start losing track of who we are.**</font> When the freedom of emptiness starts staring us in the face, it can be very scary. We go back to our wantings and attachments and identities as to a safe refuge.

We feel a desire or an attachment as part of us, as a part of our identity, as our point of view. We cling because our path is our hope of happiness, it is what we think will make us feel good. No wonder we can't imagine giving it up. It would be like wrenching out a tooth, only much more so. We feel as if we would be giving up a part of who we are.

<font color=red>And all attachment involves exclusion. It involves the limited, the partial. **We cling to something because we’re afraid to cling to nothing**. The latter would involve insecurity,falling into the abyss, stepping into the Unknown moment-by-moment. We normally shrink back from that. The Totality is scary to our mind because the mind cannot comprehend it. So we cling to the partial, missing the bliss of the Whole.</font>



## Chapter Twenty-one
Beneath the comfort and certainty on the surface is tension and anguish, which is the hidden part of the iceberg, buried deep in the unconscious part of the mind because we normally don’t want to be aware of it. Yet it’s there, and in unguarded moments we allow ourselves to feel it. Our attachments cause us to live in the future, missing the moment. We live in our dreams, missing the enoughness of Reality, missing the suchness of Existence.

**The mind is like a thirsty person who dreams of drinking water but doesn’t drink it, thinking that the dreams will slake the thirst. Or it’s like a person who studies all about water and imagines that knowledge of water is the same as drinking it. The mind is like a hungry person who instead of eating is always reading the menu. It imagines the delights of eating, but doesn’t eat. It dwells in its stories.**

What is the way out of this dilemma? Every seeking for a new answer, each renewed search for happiness only keeps us stuck in tension and suffering. Do we then forcibly give up our attachments? Do we reject them, run away from them? It doesn’t work. <font color=red>To reject something is still to be attached to it;it’s just the opposite side of the same coin</font>.

The attachment is still running us; we're still at the effect of it. That is why force doesn’t work, because it doesn't really alter anything. It alters the arrangement, but not the inner essence.

For instance, if we force ourselves to give up cigarette smoking we’ll still be at the effect of cigarettes. We’ll crave them and the attachment will show up in other areas. We may chew gum or eat candy. We might be nervous, irritable. We might yell at our family, or gain weight, or whatever.

When an attachment is renounced we’re still attached;otherwise what is the point of the renunciation? 

Then the attachment will simply move somewhere else. It will take a new form. The energy of the attachment remains, because energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It simply moves. If it does not move upward into greater consciousness then it will move into a new attachment.

<font color=red>The unfoldment of freedom is awareness</font>. All doingness, all attempts to do something about our attachments lead only deeper into the mind, because all doingness is of the mind. Only awareness is not a doingness, not a new goal. We simply see that we’ve gotten caught again, and the nature of what has caught us. No need to reject the attachment, which wouldn’t work anyway — a doingness. No, <font color=red>we just see it. Then the unattachment happens. The tape disappears</font>.

Each new path is like a drug trip. It feels good at first,we get high on it. But after a while it becomes obsessive; we cling just to avoid coming down. “I'll be able to relax as soon as I achieve such-and-such.”

Awareness is seeing that this version of reality — the one we’re running now — isn’t reality either but just another story,another dream. It’s seen and accepted for what it really is. And in that moment of clear-sighted seeing the dream loses its force; it is transcended. Suddenly it drops away from us, like a toy from a maturing child. We didn’t reject anything. Just in the observation, things can fall away — or stay.

As the current clinging either falls away through awareness or is rejected because of disillusionment, it is replaced by a new path to happiness. The illusory nature of all paths, all searches, all doingness isn’t apparent right away.So we couldn’t find the door out of the room that way,now we look for it this way. We become aware, perhaps, of the illusory nature of that path, but now we get sucked into this one. So our life can be a series of substitutions, continuing to substitute new dreams for the old ones.

No path is ultimately “bad” or “good”; there is nothing intrinsically wrong or right about any path per se. **Setting up goals and paths is what mind does — that’s what is. To reject that process would be like rejecting a cloud — foolish.**

```
per se  [ˌpɜːr ˈseɪ] 本身;本质上
```

We see the story/tape for what it is, then we’re nolonger fascinated by it. We include it, make room for it,choose it to be that way, love it for what it is. Then it becomes flimsy, it becomes less relevant, it stops running our life.

The path is never the problem. It is not the path but our 9 that keeps us trapped. All paths are good not only for whatever value is there, but also in the sense that they provide opportunities to see through them too.

All devices, all the rapies can be useful. All are channels to Reality as our awareness becomes more real. Awareness makes our moment-to-moment living — just as it is — the road to heaven.




## Chapter Twenty-two
If we're fortunate, we sooner or later begin to see that all materialist paths — that is, all paths that involve trying to manipulate our environment — do not lead to happiness. Then our search takes on a spiritual form. This is very significant,and it opens up a danger too, because <font color=red>attachments to spiritual paths are more difficult to see as attachments</font>.

Now we’re searching for enlightenment or heaven or God or no-mind or whatever the name is. As Osho points out, this is the same movement. Again, we become attached to our path, to our method. The attachment now may be to a teacher or leader. It may be to forms and rituals and dogma,or to a particular growth or consciousness movement.

It may be to a particular organization of seekers. It may be to a set of consoling beliefs, or to sacred scriptures. The attachment may be to beautiful or terrible images encountered during meditation, or it might be to psychic powers developed in such meditations. Inevitably there’s a certain metaphysical formulation involved, a certain way of looking at things, and we can become attached to that.

```
metaphysical [ˌmetəˈfɪzɪkl] 形而上学的
```

The attachment may be to serving others or to saving the world. It may be to a certain way of acting — very loving,or very high, or very surrendered. It may be to the rapture found in certain absorption states. All such attachments are accompanied by an attitude of “I’ve found it” or “I know the right way.”

Thus we may become also attached to proselytizing — not seeing that attachment to converting others covers over a deep doubt within. Otherwise, what is the need? Otherwise,we simply share what we have like a flower sharing fragrance. There’s no concern about the outcome, there is no compulsion to convert others.

```
proselytizing [ˈprɑːsələtaɪzɪŋ] 传教
```

<font color=red>Spiritual attachments are more difficult to drop than material ones precisely</font> because they’re less dense, less solid,more transparent and thus more difficult to see. It can be more difficult to see them as a dream, as just more of the mind’s tapes, as just more of the mind’s clingings.

Very often our spiritual metaphysics is associated with very reverential thoughts, very sublime conceptions. They feel better than material attachments. We feel now that we’ve left illusion behind and are on the true road. **How, we ask, can these sublime thoughts and feelings possibly be just more tapes and stories? Yet they are. It is still the mind engaged in the old game of surviving by trying to get somewhere, and clinging to something as a means.**

When awareness happens in this moment, then seeking drops for a moment, the tapes disappear for a moment. And what is left is nothing, silence. <font color=red>For in that moment of awareness there is no mind, since the mind is just tapes, thoughts. When there are no tapes there is no mind either</font>.

In that moment there’s only silence. In this silence we encounter the Existence. It is already there waiting, but we are not silent, we are not absent, so there’s no experience of It. **Actually, it’s not accurate to say that we experience/encounter Existence, since the Existence is always subject, never object, and since in that moment of awareness “you” or “I” are not there. Only the Existence is there. It encounters Itself.**

The goal of all meditation, all prayer, all spiritual paths is simply to reach this point of silence where the mind is not. Each method is beautiful in itself in that it **quiets the mind**, it gives us a taste, but then we become attached to the method and in this way the mind survives.

Also, all methods are a doingness and they presuppose that there is some goal we’re trying to reach. Methods can be extremely useful in freeing ourselves from other attachments,**but ultimately all methods must themselves be transcended**.Unless awareness happens along with the methods, we simply continue the same game of the mind at a more subtle level.Only awareness is not a method, not a trap because it’s not an activity of any kind, and does not involve trying to change anything.

For instance, surrendering to a lover or an avatar is very beautiful. To surrender is to love, it means making the other more important than oneself. It suppresses many programs and stories because *to the extent* that one surrenders one has no goals other than to be surrendered, to be in love. It gives us a taste of Existence, of bliss because the controller becomes mostly and temporarily absent.

But who is it that makes the decision to be surrendered? The mind, for all decisions are of the mind. Behind the act of surrender is the mind, active and well. And too, we can become attached to the object of our surrender, and this also is of the mind.

The act of surrendering is a drug, a program, another dream — a subtle and beautiful one. Nevertheless its effects are not permanent because they have not involved a deep awareness of the nature of the mind itself. The tapes are suppressed but not extinguished, and will return when one falls out of love, when one is no longer surrendered.

Prayer is beautiful, because it too is a form of surrender.It acknowledges that there is something greater than who we think we are, and thus the act of prayer by its very nature is an act of humility, of surrender.

```
Prayer is a form of surrender <= It acknowledges that there is something greater than who we think we are
```

Yet, what is the mind’s ultimate defense of itself? It is to set up something which is other-than-itself. The notion of a God that can be prayed to presupposes that She is separate from us in some way. It also presupposes the existence of that which is praying. In the very humility and surrender of the act of prayer can be a subtle strengthening of the mind. Can we hear ourself praying? If so, God has heard it.

Guided imagery is another method, a kind of mental motion picture, a visual story in the mind. It is very beautiful and powerful as a device for therapy, for goal-achieving, for relaxation. It can be a preliminary act to meditation. Guided“meditation” is often confused with meditation itself, but it’s not. It’s actually a kind of guided day dreaming.

Both prayer and guided imagery are still mind-motions,one with ideas and the other with images. Prayer is noisy still,it’s a mental talking. Guided imagery is the visual form of this,a visual occupation, something it shares with hallucinogenic drugs. Except for Teresa of Avila’s “prayer of quiet,” both can keep the mind involved in its doingness. This can also be so of affirmations — another kind of mind-occupation.

```
hallucinogenic [həˌluːsɪnəˈdʒenɪk] 致幻剂
```

All things have their uses at the appropriate time. All is exactly as it should be. And it’s also so, as the saying goes, that“**when we give it all up we get it all back.**”




## Chapter Twenty-three
Meditation, on the other hand, gradually quiets the mind. It is more powerful than prayer or guided imagery or affirmations since it marks a turning point — the first step from talking to listening, from visualizing to watching. To do this, meditation makes use of a particular quality of the mind, which is that the mind can only focus on one thing at a time. <font color=red>It can and does move very rapidly from one thing to another, but at a given instant it can only be occupied with one thing</font>.

If, then, the mind is held to a single object, other things are excluded. So meditation can be one-pointedness, keeping the mind focused and concentrated on one object. <font color=red>When attention wanders from the object we just gently bring the attention back to it. And we do so without condemning our wandering, for to do so would be to wander again</font>. **Meditation does not involve thinking or feeling about the object in anyway. We just focus on the object without adding anything.**

The object of meditation can be almost anything. It can be a mantra or a mandala, an internal image or sound, or an unanswerable question or paradoxical statement (a koan). It can be a picture of an avatar or a particular movement or pose by the body (tai-chi, sufi dancing, yoga). The object can be pain or the breath or a pair of eyes (tratak); it can be a candle flame, the sky, a rock or a flower. The object itself is not all that important. What makes the difference is holding one’s attention to it.

A well-developed meditation prevents our tapes from surfacing and thus quiets down the mind. It can give a taste of Reality by keeping tapes and programs out of consciousness.That taste can be a real eye-opener and can **spur our efforts on the spiritual path**. And meditation can bring about states of intense rapture, referred to as absorption levels or *jhanic* states.It can bring about lovely, exquisite images. It can bring about psychic powers of various kinds.

```
psychic [ˈsaɪkɪk] 通灵的;心灵的;关于通灵的;超自然的;有特异功能的;灵魂的
```

There are many possibilities for attachment here. We can see white lights, blue lights, hear heavenly sounds and see forms of incomparable beauty. We can meet the Buddha or Christ and have a conversation. That is why Zen people call this “going to the movies.” If we become attached to these images and sounds, then we’re simply on a sensuous mind-trip once more, for all images and sounds are mind.

Still more addictive are the psychic powers one might develop. If we meditate very intensely for a long time, especially in certain ways, then psychic powers can occur. We can develop the ability to leave our body, to foretell the future, to read minds. It is a rare person who will not become attached to such powers and others once developed. Yet ultimately it’s just another power trip on a more subtle level. It’s still the mind working and in motion.

Seductive too are experiences of rapture in jhanic states,brought about by prolonged and intense meditations. They are states of vast ecstasy, quite overshadowing what normally passes for pleasure in our life.

```
ecstasy [ˈekstəsi] 摇头丸;狂喜;入迷;陶醉;迷幻药
```

<font color=red>The state of each successive jhana is less exciting, more subtle and still than the one below</font>. We reach each higher jhanic state by being willing to let go of the grosser rapture of the one below. We see that rapture itself is a disturbance, and <font color=red>we relinquish the more exciting forms of rapture in order to obtain the deeper and more subtle ones. And each higher one can become then the new attachment</font>. But, we may ask, what is wrong with an attachment to rapture?

Nothing is wrong, yet it’s still a clinging to the limited;it’s still of the mind. The mind is still pursuing pleasure. We’ve tasted the saltiness of the ocean but we haven’t entered into it. The changes brought about are temporary, and when the meditation ends the changes slowly fade. Thus we can become attached to the meditation, to retaining the rapture resulting from it.

Concentration meditation, as it’s sometimes called, is a magnificent dream, the most beautiful of all dreams, but still a dream. It’s an exotic drug, the mind drugging itself; **but it’s still a kind of drug and sooner or later we come down from it.It’s no different in essence from other drugs we seek — power,money, fame, sex, knowledge, altered realities, cosmic satoris,saving the world, belonging to a group and so on.**

Concentration meditation <font color=red>is still a doingness, it is still the mind trying to get somewhere</font>.

Why do we meditate? In order to obtain peace, rapture,enlightenment or whatever label we give our goal. **But it is still a goal-process**. And who is doing the meditating, who is keeping the attention concentrated on the object? Observe closely and we see once more the fingerprints of the mind; we see the doingness of the controller.

Concentration meditations effects are only temporary because they don’t involve a deep seeing into the nature of the mind itself. The tapes and programs have been suppressed but they have not disappeared. They are still there, and they will surface again when we come down from this special drug.

```
专注冥想，仍然是一种有为，一种目标导向的行动，仍然属于一种念头的药物。
```

This is a difference between concentration meditation and awareness. <font color=red>Awareness does not suppress anything. On the contrary it welcomes everything, accepts it all, sees everything for what it is. And in that effortless seeing, that seeing which is non-doing and which is not of the mind, the tapes simply begin to dissolve. There is no attempt to change or improve anything. Awareness is identical with a deep acceptance. But neither is there a decision to accept either; rather, acceptance is simply there.</font>

Another way of expressing this is to recall the difference between active and passive awareness. Concentration meditation is an active awareness; it is an intense watching of the door of the train in order to see one’s lover. It’s a doingness; it is pointed in a particular direction. <font color=red>True awareness is totally passive, it is merely watching the leaves go by on the river —choosing none, preferring none, clinging to nothing. It is a silence, **a stillness that dissolves all things**.</font>

Concentration meditation is not necessary, but can be a valuable device. It is useful in that it can create a situation where awareness can begin to happen. In slowing down the mind it slows down the flow of leaves in the river, so to speak,so that a beginning awareness can more readily perceive the gaps between the leaves. But it’s not necessary. The essence of awareness is that we start just where we are, with whatever our present circumstances are.

We do not have to do concentration meditations, **we do not have to go to the mountains, we do not have to change our present situation. We simply do whatever we’re doing, but now with awareness.** We begin where we are. But if we don’t yet see the nature of the mind’s game then concentration meditation can be useful. It creates a situation where awareness can begin spontaneously, and be more penetrating.

```
spontaneously  [spɔnˈtenɪəslɪ] 自发;自然;自动;自然地
```




## Chapter Twenty-four
The same is true of a master. She is not necessary, for <font color=red>the true master is inside us</font>. But the inside master is, in a sense, still asleep, so the outside master is needed. She simply creates situation after situation until we begin to wake up and become aware, until we begin to see the true nature of our situation. She surrounds us with a fragrance to arouse us out of our slumbers and dreams.

Once we begin to become aware, then she assists us to avoid the various traps and attachments that can arise. And a true master eventually assists us to see into the nature of perhaps the greatest attachment of all — the attachment to the master. <font color=red>Ultimately, even the master must be transcended.</font>

A master is not necessary, but desirable. For while we’re asleep we're always dreaming that we’re awake. To dream that we’re awake is the best way to stay asleep. The mind’s best defense is to imagine that it’s already gone, that we’re already awake or enlightened. Without the disturbing fragrance of a master, our slumbers may continue for quite a while.

An interesting attachment is the feeling that we have to save the world. <font color=red>The world doesn’t need saving because it’s already perfect</font>.

As Byron Katie says, How do we know that the way the world is is for the highest good? Because it is that way. How do we know the world should be the way it is? Because it is that way. Simple. “Saving the world” can sometimes lead to force, violence, fanaticism. Immense suffering throughout history has been caused by those of us who were intent on saving the world by converting it to some cause or other.

Let’s observe. We see the mind at work, for this is just another form of doingness, of striving. The feeling that the world needs to be saved somehow is a deep non-acceptance of Existence as it is. It is the mind creating imperfection and wrongness out there and demanding that it be changed out there.

This is the same **disease of living in the future**. Now the whole world must struggle toward some glorious imagined utopia. What is herenow is never enough to the mind. It can never see that nothing needs to be achieved.

But if nothing needs to be achieved, why then does a master bother to teach others? Because the master has no achievement in mind; they’re simply sharing who they are.

A true master is like a flower that has bloomed in the desert. The flower gives off its fragrance not out of some compulsion but because that is its nature, that is what it does. The fragrance will be there whether anyone notices it or not. And there is no choice about it. If someone passes by, the flower does not determine whether it likes the person or not before it shares its fragrance; nor does it ask itself whether it is liked. No, the fragrance is simply there.

And the fragrance is not given off to help you or save you. It is simply there out of the flower’s abundance, out of its bliss and exuberance. The master is the same.

What’s the master doing? Actually, he is not teaching at all, for there’s no doctrine or body of knowledge to convey.That is why a master never really gives an answer, but simply destroys the question. Because he is not out to teach us some knowledge. Instead, he is out to destroy our mind.

The effort of the master is to pull all supports out from underneath us until the mind has no place left to stand. All answers just fill our mind again, so how can a master give us answers? And since he’s not giving answers he’s inexhaustible,he can go on forever. A body of knowledge is limited, but a master is unlimited. He knows nothing; he has attained to perfect ignorance, so he can keep on talking for all eternity and never exhaust the subject.




## Chapter Twenty-five
It’s said that a master is awakened, but what does that mean? What does it mean to be a master? What is this thing awakening? Is it some kind of insight? Is it formulating the final system, achieving the ultimate solution? Is it reaching the final goal?

None of those things. <font color=red>Freedom is seeing that there is no goal at all</font>. It’s the dropping of all goals, of all seeking. It’s the dropping of all attempts to improve, get better or change. But this dropping is not a doingness or decision. Rather, **it is a deep seeing that all attempts to get somewhere in anyway only lead nowhere, that they only lead further into the mind**.

It is seeing that all attempts to solve the problem, to improve, to survive, only perpetuate the problem and deepen it. It is seeing that all such attempts to solve the problem are the problem itself, and that **the problem is an illusion, that it doesn’t exist except as attempts to solve it**. All striving of any kind, therefore, simply falls away.

It is a moment when all doingness simply drops. Not that we drop it. We simply see the true reality of things and in that moment the doingness drops away of itself. This doesn’t mean that we necessarily become inactive.

Instead, it means that **we do whatever we do — without strivingness, without compulsiveness or concern.** We've been chasing our tail in a thousand different ways, whirling around faster and faster. We're dizzy from the chase, insane. Suddenly we see that the tail cannot ever be caught, that **in fact the chasing is the problem** and that there is no problem outside of the chasing.

In that moment we simply stop. All the doingness stops. We simply sit down, take a rest and let the dizziness clear. In fact the dizziness and insanity were *part-and-parcel* of the chasing itself. Now they simply drop when the chasing drops. **We see that we're flowing down the river and have been flowing down the river forever and will be flowing down the river forever.**

```
part and parcel 必要部分；重要的部分
```

**Mind wants to be different, unique, special; it wants to get somewhere, to go in its own direction. So it starts trying not to flow down the river, it starts trying to go upstream. And then the whole river, the whole Existence seems to be against us. We are trying so hard, struggling so valiantly against the river, but the river just keeps pushing us in the direction of the flow. The river seems so implacable, relentless, indifferent to our plight and our struggle. The river seems to be hostile,actively working against our will and our desires.**

Awakening is seeing that we are creating the problem.Its seeing that **the river is not against us, its simply flowing the way its flowing**. And the issue is not whether or not we're going to flow with the river, because we're going to do that in any event. **It is vast, and “you” and “I” are atoms.**`无我`

Rather, the issue really is whether we will struggle or not as we flow down the river. The question is whether we’ll become aware of who is creating the struggle in our life. To the extent that we push against the river the river seems to push back, but the river is not the problem.

<font color=red>If there is awareness moment-to-moment of the mind’s struggles then moment-to-moment they disappear; then we can listen to our inner voice and cease our struggling with the river. We stop struggling with Existence. Then we’re in a deep bliss as we flow down the river. Then we celebrate existence moment-by-moment.</font>

We see that all attempts to improve our struggles are only more struggling. And if we try to stop struggling and try to flow down the river, then we’re in tension. How can we try to flow down the river? We’re already doing it. <font color=red>It’s just a deep let-go</font>, there’s no trying or efforting. All trying, all efforting just keeps the game going.

**Mind is like a bicycle — it must keep moving or it will fall down. It goes on creating struggle, searching,survival,desire. It creates movement, striving, change, because otherwise it simply disappears, it falls down. <font color=red>Mind is the struggle itself</font>. Without the struggle there’s no mind either.**

The mind as controller, as chooser, as decider, as the “I” just disappears. It was an illusion all along, it never existed except as the struggle. But the computing mechanism is still there, and it can be used as a tool just as a hammer is picked up and used when needed. The capability to compute is still there, but the computer is silent unless called upon.

If an awakened person crosses a street the computer-brain will figure out the right time to cross. But the mind, the“separate” person is vanished. That which struggled to control,that which thought of itself as the “I” is gone because it was only the struggle itself. Now the Existence, the Self crosses the street. The guests — thoughts, tapes, the mind — took over the house while the host was away, but now the host has returned.

The master does not need to effort. After all, the river flows by itself. Indeed, at the deepest level we are the river. <font color=red>We’ve already arrived. What are we struggling about?</font>




## Chapter Twenty-six
Freedom is a deep seeing that this is it. This is the way it is. This is the way it turned out. Is is is... **Things are the way they are**. And things are not the way they are not. Right now,nothing can be any different than the way it is. **In the next moment it may be different, but right now it can’t be any different**. And <font color=red>all there ever is is right now</font>. **The future never arrives, because it’s always just right now.**

This is it, this is the way the river is flowing. To accept it is to enjoy it. But the acceptance is not a decision, it’s rather a deep awareness that this is the way it is. Love and acceptance are carried within awareness as a seed.

**Awakening is seeing that things are never going to be any different than the way they are... until they are.** It is seeing that the river is going to flow this way forever... unless it flows some other way. The clouds will go north until they don't.The sun will rise unless it doesn’t. All attempts to change or find the answer simply fall away as we become aware of this. At the deepest level, all there ever is to do is to notice the way it is right now, to be fully conscious of it. Then we’re **in deep harmony with the way things are**. We’re in deep harmony with Existence.

To use a different terminology, all there ever is to do is to get off our positions. We get on a position, get off it, on another position, off it, on it, off it — forever. It’s not as if we get off all our positions *once and for all*. That would be like trying to eat breakfast once and for all.

```
once and for all 彻底地 ; 一劳永逸地
```

No, the tapes will always be running... until they don't. And what there is to do when they come up is to <font color=red>notice them,be aware of them as what they are</font>. Then they flatten, they disappear. **We don’t do anything with them. We don’t ignore them, reject them or try to change them. We simply notice them... like leaves on the river.**

The ground from which we perceive things transforms. Before, the ground was unawareness and sometimes we were aware. After, the ground is awareness and sometimes we’re unaware. But the circumstances of our life look the same — the same tapes still run, and sometimes we’re aware of them and sometimes not.. .just as before. Everything is the same.

Everything is the same, but it is being perceived in a new way. If life is a bowl of cherries, then the cherries — the circumstances of our life — have not changed, but the bowl itself has changed.

And what is that difference? Before, the bowl — the context in which everything is held — was that certain things needed to be achieved or changed. After, the ground is that this is the way it is, and that <font color=red>all there ever is to do is to be aware of the way it is</font>. Since that is not a doingness, it’s doing nothing. But again, doing nothing doesn’t necessarily look like inactivity; it looks like just doing what we do.

**Just doing what we do, following our inner guidance,without performing our actions as means to an end. Then each action can become a blissful end-in-itself.**

```
致吾心之良知
```

It is as if we’ve been trying all our life to liberate ourself from a room in which we’re trapped. And we’ve been pushing ceaselessly against the door, trying to get out, and it hasn’t budged. Our efforts in pushing against the door — the movements of the mind — never flag even for a moment, but it’s all to no avail. The door just won’t open. Awakening is seeing that the door opens inwards, and that pushing against the door is what has been preventing it from opening.

Or to put it another way, awakening is seeing that the door won’t open because it’s the wrong door — so why push against it? But it’s worse than that. Awakening is seeing that it’s impossible to ever find the right door, and then, seeing that there are no doors at all, just solid walls. And then seeing that not only are there no doors, there are no walls either; infact, there is no room!

It’s seeing that we’re already out of the room, because no room is there. The room was an illusion created by the mind so that it would have something to do — to try to get out. But how can we get out of a room when we’re already out? <font color=red>This is mind, struggling to get to a place where it already is, striving to achieve a result that’s already achieved</font>.




## Chapter Twenty-seven
It’s been said that awakening is finding out that there’s no such thing as awakening. The mind sets up awakening or cosmic consciousness or whatever as another goal, the greatest goal. In Osho’s great metaphor, mind thinks that freedom is the top rung of a ladder somewhere. Mind is a compulsive ladder-climber; it carries its ladder around with it and when it finds a good spot it sets it down and starts climbing again. Of course, others need to be elbowed out of the way. And there’s no end to the rungs — mind can always create more.

**But awakening is not at the top of some ladder, some hierarchy. It’s getting down off all the ladders forever.** More accurately, it’s seeing that the ladders are a creation of the mind, that there are no ladders. So there’s no need to get to the top of them, and no need to get off them either.

<font color=red>We’re already off — as soon as we see that we are</font>. As soon as we see that we’re off the ladders, we see that we have always been off them because there are no ladders. In the instant of awakening, we see that we’ve always been awakened because there’s no awakening to achieve. Awakening is seeing that nothing whatever needs to be achieved, including of course awakening itself. It just happens when it does.

We’ve been dreaming, and in the dream creating walls,obstacles, barriers, as well as power and money, achievements and pleasures. We’ve gone quite far away in the dream, to a distant city, and finally in the dream we begin to realize that we are very far away indeed from home.

Then it seems as if it will be very arduous to get back.We begin using various devices.. .workshops, metaphysics,concentrations, gurus. ..but the journey back seems endless.We’re too far away, it seems.. .how to get back?

But the problem is the dreaming itself. The problem is that we’re still in a dream. In fact, **who we really are is already herenow, we have only to awaken to it**. It only seems as if we are far away — **we have only to awaken and we’re back home instantly**.

All spiritual methods are simply to change the nature of our dream so that we can awaken from it. Until we awaken,methods and devices are necessary to tamper with the dream.. .make it more pleasant, less pleasant, more peaceful,more anxious, whatever.. .until we awaken. Then the dreaming is ended and the devices are too. So **a master uses different devices with different people. It depends on what they see in the dream**, how they sense that someone’s dream needs to be disturbed.

The great teachings stress that awakening happens in an instant. For no preparation needs to be made. It’s not a journey, therefore nothing needs to be done. There is no question of changing the circumstances of one’s life first, or of changing one’s programming. Journeys and preparations and changes all take time; they are all of the mind, part of the dream. No, one simply awakens; it is instantaneous. We just see, no preparation is needed. And in that seeing the concept of awakening itself is discarded. It too was simply a device. **Infact, the mind cannot be enlightened. The mind is actually an illusion; with what will we enlighten it?**




## Chapter Twenty-eight
<font color=red>If awakening happens in an instant, why doesn’t it happen to us right now, this instant? </font>Because we — the mind —don’t want it to. We want to continue to cling to our goals, our attitudes, our beliefs, our patterns and payoffs. We want to stay in movement. We don’t want to be awakened this instant because we would have to let go of the idea that we can control, choose, decide, make things different or better. We would have to let go of who we think we are and what we think we are doing. We would have to let go of “you” and “I,” and we’re not ready. The dream is familiar, and the problems are old friends — we’re not ready.

So, paradoxically, time is needed. There is actually no need for it, but we cause it to be needed. Now time is needed for awareness to develop. It’s not a preparation, for no changes are necessary. Rather, we’ll continue to cling, but awareness will flower in us by and by.. .and then one day it will happen.Our awareness will have become strong enough so that suddenly we see through all our efforts to remain occupied. We see that awareness is all that is ever needed or possible, and that our efforts to achieve a result are what have been causing the delay.

This is satori, awakening. But it’s not the final, ultimate liberation. It is not the case that after satori we will never run a tape again, never desire again, never again project our version of reality onto reality. Those things will still happen, we can expect them. But the ground has shifted. Now <font color=red>when those things happen we watch them, observe them</font>. ..except when we don’t.

And we’ve seen that ultimately this witnessing is all that can ever be done, and that it’s not a doing. So nothing is being done, nothing is being changed, everything is the same. Yet things begin happening around us. <font color=red>As awareness increases,reality changes for us</font>. We begin living in a different world,even though it’s the same world. Problems clear up or are nolonger experienced as problems, because all problems at bottom are just due to insufficient consciousness.

As we continue to **watch the mind**, awareness deepens. And as the awareness deepens, more and more tapes lose energy, lose force, lose reality. More and more of them become transparent and then disappear. It’s not that we’re trying to make them disappear. There’s an acceptance of them, we’re perfectly willing to have them there. In that very acceptance,though, they start disappearing of their own accord. And as they start disappearing a great silence increasingly descends on us. We become more and more still within.

```
watch the mind
```

And then one day the final, the ultimate happens. The tapes are all gone, they are simply there no more. And we’re there no more either. All desires, all goals, all clingings, all programs are absent, extinguished. There is no past and no future anymore, there is only the moment. <font color=red>**The ego’s smoky candle flame has gone out, but now the sun lights up the sky.We are dead, we are gone, but now God is alIive.**</font> While we were, God was not. Now that we are not, God is. Existence Itself now dances through the form where we used to be. The inner Melody just moves through us.

<font color=red>This is nirvana, the final enlightenment.</font> And “nirvana”is such a beautiful word, for it means “no burning.” There’s nolonger the burning of desire, of striving and clutching. And in the absence of that, in that utter emptiness there’s a quiet bliss that’s beyond happiness, beyond excitement, beyond the thrill of any kind of experience. The bliss of Existence Itself.
Now It moves, It controls.
As Jesus said: “Thy will be done.”



# Silence

## Chapter Twenty-nine
Clouds float across the sky. They’re not trying to go anywhere. They’re not trying to accomplish anything. They are not choosing where to go. They are just drifting, letting the Existence carry them along. There is no decision-making,no trying, no struggle. There is a let-go, but **not even a let-go,for there is no controller to let go**. There’s simply peace. There is what is.

All of Existence is like this. There is no purpose to it,no meaning, no goal. As Osho said, <font color=red>meaning and purpose are constructions of the mind which it imposes on Existence</font>. The mind thinks that Existence has to get somewhere, that there has to be some purpose to it all, that someday some far-flung omega-point will be reached and that was the purpose. But then what is the purpose of the omega-point? <font color=red>Purpose is always an infinite regression, it always depends on something else. What is right now is never enough.</font>

```
far-flung 遥远的；分布广的；广泛的；
omega-point 奥米茄点，一切发展与进化的终点；
```

<font color=red>**The purpose of Existence is just to be here right now,being what It is. It is totally sufficient in Itself at each instant.It has no purpose except Itself. It has no reason except Itself. The rose is not trying to be something else; it is in bliss to be what it is this moment**.</font>

Clouds, rivers, trees, life itself — all of Existence is in a deep ecstasy. All except us humans. We humans are in secret misery because our mind can't accept this moment; we must try to be somewhere else. We must try to control. We must make decisions. The mind is always serious — there are things to be done. Even when we let go, even when we laugh its only on the surface. Deep down the mind is still serious.

Existence, on the other hand, is playing. It is having fun with no goal. Yes, there is death. There is pain. But death is an integral part of life, its absolutely necessary to life. <font color=red>Life and death are not opposed to each other, they are two faces of the same thing</font>. Death clears out the rigidity, the calcification, the stuckness, the willfulness, the dead unbending ness and thus makes life possible.

```
unbending ness 不屈不挠
```

Life is flexibility, its suppleness, its the ability to adjust to change, to bend with the wind. A tree begins as a flexible sapling and ends as dried-out stiffness. **Without death there would be no life, for there could be no change, no room for life.** All would come to a standstill. Death/life are inseparable;they’re the same phenomenon.

<font color=red>Similarly, pleasure is impossible without pain. They’re inseparable; they’re also one phenomenon. The mind creates them, separates them, then tries to cling to the one and avoid the other. **Mind can’t accept the totality; that’s why it misses.**When we’re feeling pleasure, pain is taking a rest. It’s gathering energy, it will soon come to the fore. When we’re feeling pain, pleasure is taking a rest and gathering energy; soon it will come.</font>

When the pendulum swings to one side it must then swing to the other, but it remains the same pendulum. Beauty is impossible without ugliness. Good is impossible without evil. Happiness and sadness depend on each other. Love and hate include each other. <font color=red>Dualities come into existence at the same time</font>. Mind creates them. **Existence is simply what it is.Mind creates polarities and interpretations about it.**

```
有无相生
polarities n.
(两种倾向、意见等的)截然对立，两极化;极性(两极并存的状态) polarity的复数
```

Existence in its suchness is perfect as it is. Which is more perfect, ice or water? **All is equal, nothing is better than anything else. Nothing is more important than anything else.** Nothing is needed for all to be complete. Which is better, a long blade of grass or a short blade? Both are perfect. The Existence is perfect, and goes from perfection to perfection.This looks illogical. If reality is going to be perfect, how can it already be perfect? This makes no sense to the mind, for the mind is a perfectionist — always wanting to achieve perfection. But how can it achieve perfection when Existence is already perfect? It’s an absurd task.

```
All is equal ?
```

But what about disease, poverty, evil? What exists is what exists, only the mind labels certain parts of it as “bad.”Good and bad depend upon our point of view. If we see a cat kill a mouse, that is not evil to us; that’s just nature. But to the brother of the mouse it is evil. What threatens our survival or the survival of that which we identify with is “bad” to us; what assists our survival we then call “good.” **To see good and bad requires a position, a point of view, an identity.** <font color=red>When there is no identity and no position there is no bad, and no good either. Then all simply is what it is</font>.

**There is no way to foresee the ultimate consequences of anything. That which we call bad may lead to good. That which we label good may lead to bad**. Certain monastic orders did many good deeds and also administered the Inquisition;was the founding of the orders good or bad? Drug pushing in Harlem led to capital formation for black businesses. Was this good or bad? The mind is a limited instrument and cannot see more than very limited consequences.

```
祸兮福之所倚，福兮祸之所伏。
monastic orders 修道会
cannot see more than 只能看到
```

Finally, Existence appears to be a multiplicity on the surface, but that is just appearance, that is the projections and discriminations of mind. Beneath the apparent multiplicity created by the mind, we find oneness.. .the One. Existence is non-dual. Existence is eternal and changeless and yet appears to change, **just as the sky has light and darkness and snow and rain, yet remains itself unaffected by any of it.** The One is not poor, not rich, neither diseased nor healthy, neither good nor bad — and that is who we really are, that is all there is.

The One has no attributes and yet has all attributes — It has all the forms of the world. This is the divine dance, the divine play. Beneath each form is the One, is Existence itself,and It is bliss. Existence does not suffer. Except for humans,the forms of Existence can feel pain but not suffering. Only we suffer, because <font color=red>only we compare and desire and feel ourselves to be separate</font>. Only we are attached to things being a certain way — and that’s the only cause of suffering. It isn’t logical, but it can be seen.




## Chapter Thirty
To say that Existence is One is the same as saying that Existence is everything, **for if it is One it leaves nothing out**.If something were left out then Existence would no longer be non-dual, it would no longer be One.

Similarly, to say that Existence is One is the same as saying that It is emptiness, nothingness, for one can only be understood in contrast to two; **if Existence is One then there’s nothing to contrast it with, and so it is the same as saying it’s nothing.**

```
Existence = One = Nothing
因为One包含所有，所以没有任何东西可以拿来和One比较，因为无法被比较，所以无法被分辨，所以One什么也不是。
```

The ocean is one, but to a fish it’s the very quality of existence. There is no way to get outside of it, no way to contrast it with anything else, so to a fish the ocean is nothing, it doesn't exist. If a pencil is expanded until it is everything it vanishes, it becomes nothing. Not only is the One everything,the totality — It is also nothing, emptiness, the Void.

This description can also apply to the person who has reached <font color=red>nirvana, final awakening</font>. **They are everything, they are nothing, they are one.** They’re one because they’re unified,they’re in harmony. There’s no longer any distinction between the conscious and unconscious mind, because everything is conscious.

```
nirvana = final awakening
```

Such a person is **no longer a cacophony of successive mind-states** — anger replaced by hope frustration replaced by gratification, etc. Instead, they are in peace and serenity; they are in a deep harmony with All. There are nolonger conflicting elements — love competing with hate, greed competing with fear, happiness competing with grief. Now all of it is included, all is transcended. They are whole, complete,serene. They are One.

Such a person is also everything, the Totality, because there are no longer any boundaries. Trees merge into the sky merge into clouds merge into others. **Not that they don’t use labels and concepts when appropriate, but they <font color=red>just play with them as utensils, devices</font>. They <font color=red>no longer see the labels and concepts as reality</font>. Reality for them is All, is One.**

```
一切皆是”物“，天地不仁，以万物为刍狗；圣人不仁，以百姓为刍狗。
```

There’s no longer any experiential separation between such a person and someone else. When she helps her neighbor there is no thought of “help,” when she loves her neighbor there is no thought of “love.” The neighbor is her, she is her neighbor. It is simply the left hand washing the right.

She is also nothing, for she is empty. She is empty of desires, attitudes, models, concepts, positions, attachments,goals, judgments, rigidities. She is empty of tapes, empty of programming. **She can use such things when appropriate, but otherwise <font color=red>there is silence within; they do not run her</font>.** For instance, if she talks about what has happened to her she will use concepts and positions to do so, but she won’t take them seriously. They won’t be “truth” to her, they won’t be “reality.”She’ll just play with them.

And if she talks again tomorrow she’ll probably contradict what she said today, and deliberately so. For the listening mind will try to box up what she says, to position it, to make it into the “truth.” So the awakened person will break up tomorrow the concepts she put together today.

For she knows that what she is talking about can’t be contained anyway. What she is really doing is using words to point to something beyond words, she is using structures to allude to something beyond structures. She’s hinting, she’s using metaphor, she’s playing with boxes and structures but doesn’t take them seriously. She’s not attached to them. Her real message is the silence between the words, the emptiness beneath the structures. She uses words to seduce people into silence.

She’s empty of goals. Yet if she goes to the supermarket to buy apples it will appear that she’s set up a goal to that effect. But that’s only the appearance. It is all equal to her. If her car has a flat tire on the way, that is just as good as the apples to her. She has no preference. She was just playing with the apples and the supermarket, it was just a dance.

If now the dance moves this way instead of that way, it is all the same to her. It is beautiful this way too. Whatsoever happens is beautiful to her, she’ll celebrate it. For she is **silent inside**. **She can play with goals, models, concepts, attitudes when the moment arises, but she doesn’t cling to them — and they don’t come unless she asks them.** They do not run her because they don’t come uninvited. Besides, she’s not there,there is nobody to run.

She is not there <font color=red>because who she was has died</font>. Who she thought she was was her beliefs, attitudes, thoughts, goals,emotions, sensations, desires, status — all of her positions, all the limited things that she clung to. She thought she was her programming. Now all that is dead.

It’s not that the computing machinery is not there anymore. It is there, but it computes now only when called upon.It doesn’t manufacture stories and behaviors of its own accord anymore. And it’s not that the tapes are erased. They are there in storage — she can remember them if she wants to — but now **they are memories only**. There is no identification with them. They have no reality, no force, no energy. They don’t come up of their own accord, in response to stimuli. They come up only if called upon. As they used to be, they no longer exist.

Because the tapes don’t exist anymore, she doesn’t exist anymore either. Because who she used to be was just the tapes and programs, including ones that she existed separately, that she was choosing, that she knew what was true.

Now she is gone and there is no-mind, emptiness. Now the Divine is there, the Existence is there, the Ocean is there. Because she is gone, God is at home. Now there is no more controller, no more chooser. There never was; there were only tapes with the concept of a controller, a decider. When the controller, the chooser disappeared she disappeared too. Now Existence chooses. Now the Mystery is the controller.




## Chapter Thirty-one
Who is beating our heart right now? If we are, then let’s will it to stop beating. Who is filtering our blood? If we are,then let’s will it to stop for a few moments. In truth, Existence caused us to be born, Existence is beating our heart, Existence is breathing us. It is moving the sun and stars, it is moving the electron around the nucleus, it’s blowing the wind and raining the rain.

It’s doing all of it — all of it absolutely. Why, then, do we persist in believing that we must fend for ourself, that we must look out for #1? <font color=red>Existence is taking care of our heart; will it not take care of us?</font> Our life is no more than a dewdrop on a leaf, slowly falling off — why all this fighting, ambition, struggling, seeking? We are a drop of rain evaporating in the sun. Let’s enjoy it! Can we see our real situation?

Let’s look within and let a deep trust arise. Let’s let ourself be borne on the back of Existence. Let’s let the river carry us. In truth, It’s carrying us anyway. Why struggle?

```
大块载我
```

But this is not enough for the mind. The mind finds it difficult to trust. The mind asks, “But what if I die? What if I don’t get enough to eat? What if I don’t get enough money? What if I don’t get the right partner?” And so on.

<font color=red>Mind’s questions presuppose certain preferences</font>. But the awakened person has no more preferences. If death comes,good; she’ll celebrate it. If hunger comes, good; she’ll celebrate it. If illness comes, good; she’ll celebrate it. If joy comes, good;she’ll celebrate it. If the wind blows through the trees, good;she’ll celebrate it. **Whatsoever it is, she will celebrate it, she will be grateful for it.** And in truth, the river is going to flow wherever It flows anyway. Why not celebrate the way It is,whatever It is?

```
Whatsoever it is, she will celebrate it, she will be grateful for it.

```

There is a true story of the Sufi master Bayazid and his disciples who came to a town at night. It was cold and raining and they were hungry, but the townspeople would not let them in. So they went to an adjacent hill, and there Bayazid praised God for his many blessings. One of his disciples said,“Now this is too much, you have gone too far. We are hungry,cold, wet tonight — and you’re praising God?” Bayazid replied,“I must praise Him, for He fulfills my needs so beautifully. Tonight I need to be hungry. Tonight I need to be cold and in poverty. Tonight I need to be wet and shivering. Otherwise,why should He give them to me? He takes care of my needs so perfectly.”

This is the trusting being. There’s a let-go, there is **no struggle anymore**. <font color=red>In his heart there is acceptance and joy and a deep gratitude for All that is</font>. His gratitude and acceptance are so great that he cannot contain them; they overflow in a profound bliss that is independent of circumstances.

Just to see the sky is too great a gift for him, it overflows into bliss. Just to see a tree blow in the wind or hear the crickets cry is the fulfillment of his being. To eat his dinner or to look into the eyes of another is the meaning of his existence. It is totally complete, moment-by-moment. Nothing is lacking. All is perfect. Simply that things be what they are, that is all that he asks.

Actually, it is not even accurate to say that he is trusting or accepting, for that implies a decision about it. Accurately,he doesn’t trust, he doesn’t accept, for there’s nobody there.There is no one to be trusting or accepting. Simply, there is trust, there is acceptance. There is gratitude, celebration, bliss. They’re simply there.

Such a person sees that there is nothing to do and that nothing is needed, so he doesn’t do anything. To the mind this sounds as if he lays down and goes to sleep, but in fact it just means that he does what he does. The inner Melody moves by Itself. The Voice moves through that hollow flute.




## Chapter Thirty-two
Doing nothing does not have a particular form to it; it doesn't look a certain way. It is not a form or doingness, but **a state of mind. More accurately, a state of no-mind, a state of absence.**

```
a state !
```

When a bird sings it isn’t thinking about how it must sing today and it doesn’t have a goal about finishing its song. It has no purpose in mind, it is not trying to accomplish anything. It’s simply singing out of its exuberance, there is no goal or meaning about it. It’s doing nothing. The awakened person is the same. He “does nothing” because he is not attached to any goal; **his mind is silent, absent**.

From that silence he spontaneously does each moment whatever will be most harmonious and appropriate. He does not think about it, there’s no decision. He simply does what he does; whatever happens, happens. There is no doingness,there is no effort anymore. All effort is gone. All is spontaneous, effortless, harmonious, compassionate. Yet to some-one’s mind it may not look that way.

He may strike a devotee, as many Zen masters did. To the mind this looks cruel. But it may be the precise action that will awaken that devotee in that moment, in that situation. It may be the greatest compassion. There is no way to judge it,Existence itself is acting. He may found a hospital, or throw a party. He may teach people how to dance, or sit silently. He may comfort a weeping person. Or he may not;he may want that person to fully experience the grief. There is no way to tell what he will do, or what he should do.

The mind takes the concept of awakening and decides what it would look like, what an awakened master would do and say and act like. And it is like a caterpillar trying to decide how a butterfly should act. There is no way for it to know, for it can only think in caterpillar terms.

Awakening has no form, no structure; it doesn't look a particular way. There are people who think that an awakened being should look always loving or always serene or whatever their model is. But a master may be stern or gentle, talkative or silent, playful or penetrating, depending on the moment. **He uses forms, they do not use him**. He plays with whatever form is most appropriate to the moment.

The awakened being has no doctrines, no moral code,no set of rules. None are needed. Moral codes are attempts to curb the innate violence and greed of the mind. They are necessary restrictions imposed from the outside since the inside spirit is lacking. A master is absolutely moral, but **the ethics is flowing from the inside out and no set of rules can contain it**. His morality is a function of the moment; it’s a spontaneous,harmonious response. He is not thinking in terms of being“moral” or “good.” He simply responds in the appropriate way. He is **just natural, flexible**.

```
moral code 道德准则
```

All other so-called moralities are suppressions of the mind’s greed and violence, they are a using of force against force. With the mind in control they are sometimes necessary,but they’re not natural.

**Humans have become the most unnatural animal, infact the only unnatural animal.** We’re addicted to force since we want to change things and we feel it is very important that they be changed. We don’t see that all problems reside within our own mind, are creations of our mind. We don’t see that **using force to accomplish our ends is like trying to pry open a flower by force**. Nothing is accomplished except destroying the flower.

Existence is doing it all. Existence opens up millions of flowers everyday, no force is needed. No help at all is needed. What can we do? We can just stay out of the way and let the river flow. It will take care of everything. It already is taking care of everything, we just don’t see it. When we drop our struggling and our models of how it should be, we find that It’s already carrying us and always has been.

We humans have surrounded ourselves with dogmas,rules, regulations. We create our own prison with our mind,and then cling to our bars because they are familiar to us, they are a known item. **Mind feels comfortable with the known,threatened by the unknown because mind cannot exist in the unknown.** The unknown is infinite, wild, unpredictable; it is the very fabric of Existence itself. So even though we may be in misery in our prison, we cling to our dogmas and our rules and rituals.

They serve the purpose of reducing the unlimited to the limited. They reduce the unknowable to the knowable. They are familiar, a comfortable misery. Then we try to escape this prison by improving things, including improving our rules and dogmas. This is like decorating our cell with jewels,replacing the iron bars with gold ones. Were still in prison.

**The person of wisdom**, on the other hand, is free. One of the names for awakening is moksha , liberation. She's willing to go wherever life leads her. She knows nothing, and knows that she knows nothing. She has no rules, no guidelines, no security. She plunges into the unknown moment-by-moment. She is surrendered to Existence, she trusts it totally. She is grateful just to be alIive, just to breathe. If life gives her bitter fruit to eat, she is grateful for it. If life gives her sweet fruit,she's grateful for it. It's all the same, there's no sweet or bitter.She is simply aware; she watches.

This awareness is the key. If her body-mind cries or becomes sad, she's not identified with it. She’s a witness to it,she watches this beautiful flower of sadness. She doesn't try to stop it or push it away or distract herself. She watches it just as she would watch the clouds in the sky or the ripples on a lake. The sadness has its own beauty.

**There's no difference for her between inner phenomena and outer phenomena, between emotions passing and clouds passing; she watches both. They are the same — simply waves on the surface of Existence. As she watches the sadness, by and by it disappears like a cloud passing to the horizon. It was beautiful but she doesn't cling to it.**

Now she witnesses whatever is next. It might sound as if she’s indifferent, but she’s not — she’s just detached. To be indifferent is to have little or no interest in life. Either life has beaten down such a person and they’ve become filled with hopelessness, or they’ve become jaded and cynical about life and it appears dull and tedious.

The person of freedom is not indifferent at all. He is very alIive to life. He is filled with it moment-to-moment,whatsoever it is; he is spontaneous. But he’s detached because he **does not cling to any particular part of life**. He lets each moment go to make way for whatever is in the next moment. He is open, receptive, flexible... but not indifferent in the least.He watches all, accepts all, but clings to nothing, identifies with nothing.

He is **like an empty mirror**. Whatsoever stands in front of the mirror is reflected faithfully. The mirror does not ask whether you are beautiful or ugly, male or female, friendly or hostile, healthy or sick, rich or poor, young or old, powerful or helpless. The mirror doesn’t try to avoid you, it doesn’t ask you to stand in front of it. It has neither a version nor desire.

It simply reflects you faithfully when you are in front of it. It is filled with you. But it does not identify with you, it does not feel that its survival depends on you. It is not worried about survival at all. **When you leave the mirror does not cling, it lets you go. It does not ask you to stay, it does not cling even for a moment.**

The person of wisdom is like this. His consciousness is empty, silent. **If something comes into his consciousness he accepts it, loves it, is grateful for it, but doesn’t cling to it.** Even to say that he does these things is inaccurate, for he is not there. Rather, the acceptance, the love, the gratitude is simply there.

Even to say that they are there is inaccurate, for there is no concept that they are there. **There is just a perfect reflection of what is there, an unstained consciousness of what is there, a choiceless mirror-like awareness of what is there —and this is the acceptance and love.**





## Chapter Thirty-three
Love is often thought of as something we do. But have you ever tried to love? It feels shallow, false. <font color=red>Whenever we are trying to be something, it means we're not that thing</font>. Otherwise, what’s the point of trying? If we’re trying to be pregnant,we’re not. If we’re trying to be loving, we’re not loving. <font color=red>The very effort of trying means it is not genuine, it is not natural.</font> Love isn’t a trying, it’s not an attitude. It is not an activity. It’s not a shining glow in the eyes, and it’s not a melting feeling. And it’s not an intoxication with someone or something.

Love isn’t a feeling or a point of view or a doingness. It has no form to it, it doesn’t look a particular way. The mind doesn’t love, for love is possible only when there aren’t any attachments or objectives, when the moment alone is everything. It is the Self that loves.

Love isn’t something that has to be achieved, not something that has to be put into place. It is always there. Always it is there, but it’s obscured by mind just as clouds obscure the sun. Let the mind fall away through awareness, and suddenly love is there, it is already there. It has always been there. It is the bottomline. We can’t do it. Yet become still inside and it is already present. **When mind is absent, love is present**.

Since love is at the level of the Self, it has no form to it. Its like a fragrance emanating from a flower. It is there; we may partake or not, as we wish. Its like a gentle rain which waters good crops and bad crops alike. It has no preferences,it makes no choices.

It is unconditional, it asks for nothing in return. On the contrary, its an overflowing, it has too much already. It is like rain clouds pregnant with water; theres a gratitude that the thirsty earth is willing to receive the rain. It is like an orange blossom heavy with nectar; it is grateful when the bee takes some. Love asks for nothing. What could it ask for? It is already full, it is overflowing.

Love doesn't try to possess, for it doesn't need anything. It allows perfect freedom, for nothing is needed in return. **If something is needed** — some commitment, some expression of gratitude — **then it's not love.** **Love and freedom are not separable; they're two wings of the same bird**. Possessiveness is always of the mind; it is about being unfilled, about lacking something. Love is full, it doesn’t cling. It will not try to hold anyone. It accepts whatever is, each moment. It's not attached,it has no preferences. Like the sun, it shines on all things.

To love, the quality of all relationships is the same. The quantity may differ — more time may be spent with some than with others — but the quality is identical. The mind rebels at this, for it always wants to be special and unique and to focus on the special and unique. **But to love, each person has the same essence; indeed, everything in Existence has the same essence.**

True love is non-directional, therefore. It’s not directed towards particular persons or things; it has no address on it. It is open to everyone and everything.

Love is easily misunderstood by the mind. For instance,the mind may decide that it is very loving now and that its love is unconditional. This has nothing to do with love, for **real love is unconscious of itself and has nothing to do with decisions or self-image**.

Alternatively, mind may interpret having no preferences as some formula about sexual promiscuity or celibacy. This conceives of love as an activity or a denial, and it’s neither one. **Romance, sex, renunciation are all drugs, intoxicants; they are a doingness and we come down from them.** We don’t come down from love because it is not an up.

<font color=red>Love is not hot as passion is. Neither is it cold. It is just in the middle — a quiet, subtle, warm fragrance which can’t be practiced or implemented, but which expresses spontaneously when the mind is no longer there.</font>




## Chapter Thirty-four
Acceptance is also easily misconceived by the mind. “So if all things are perfect then I might as well hurt or deceive others — what difference does it make?” **Such an attitude sees acceptance *or its lack* as a decision. But <font color=red>acceptance just arises on its own when the mind is silent</font>**. So it has nothing to do with any conclusion by the mind that hurting or deceiving others is okay. Such a decision would merely be another tape of the mind, more of its survival programming.

This does not mean to stop doing what we do. That would just be a suppression, a violence; the thwarted energy will not go away but will distort us, it will show up in some other form.

If we eat meat, we might continue to do so but now eat meat with awareness. If we deceive others, we might continue to do so but observe ourselves as we do it. Let’s watch. Let’s observe. If we’re a thief let’s add awareness to our thievery —it will fall from us, for it’s not possible to steal consciously. **Let’s not try to change ourselves or blame ourselves, because all that is the usual game. Trying to change ourselves hasn’t worked and won’t work at the deepest level. Yet in becoming aware, certain things fall away from us.**

If we force ourselves to give something up then the desire will still be there, just suppressed. But as we become aware, certain things just fall away. There is no effort, no struggle involved. Those things that drop away are “sins.” Those that don’t are “virtues.” **It’s a natural process**.

```
force and suppressed，是一种低阶手段，高阶手段都是自然的。
```

Ultimately, the attempt to fight or suppress “sin” or the undesirable is an attempt to fight with darkness. But at the deepest level, as Osho points out, darkness does not exist — it’s just an absence of light. How then can we defeat it? <font color=red>How can we defeat something that fundamentally is an absence?</font>

The mind says in effect, “I must get rid of this darkness first before I can turn on the light.” Can we see what the mind is doing? <font color=red>We don’t need to bother about the darkness in our life or in the lives of others, it’s a futile struggle. Far more effective is to turn on a light.</font>

When the light is turned on, darkness vanishes. There is no need to fight with it; no effort is needed. A room can be dark for many years, yet it still takes only a moment to turn on the light and then the darkness is gone.

**Fighting sin is like fighting an enemy in a dream. We don’t need to defeat him; we can just wake up.** If we’re being harmed by others, or if we’re the one doing the harming, or if we’re harming ourself, we can put our focus and energy on turning on a light in the situation.

<font color=red>What is that light?</font> It **can be finding a positive goal that all can put their energy toward.** It **can be a love warm enough to dissolve barriers and hatreds**. It **can be looking within to see how our own stories are perpetuating our separateness.**

In doing this, any type of rigidity that we try to impose on ourself or life is again a suppression, a form of violence. <font color=red>Life is flexibility, openness, a plunge into the unknown each moment.</font> How can this occur if we're frozen into a structure? **A slavish devotion to rules or discipline can make us dead inside**. Even awareness can be made into a discipline if it is approached rigidly; then it is not awareness because it has the smell of effort, of tension. **The whole point is to become less and less tense inside, more and more open and relaxed.**

```
对任何规则任何教条奴隶般的忠诚将会使我们原本拥有的内在的灵活性死亡。
```

Like anything else, rules and disciplines can be useful as devices. They can alter the dream so that the dreamer may begin to rouse from his slumbers. But **whatever we might use as a device, lets relax into it, ease into it, flow with it.**

<font color=red>Lets let everything lead us to increased relaxation, for awakening is simply the ultimate relaxation</font>.**If we decide to sit quietly from six to seven every morning, for instance, lets approach it as a relaxation; lets let it be a deep easiness. **If we approach it as a heavy, serious duty we’ll destroy the whole value of it.**

```
awakening is simply the ultimate relaxation.
```

<font color=red>If we use discipline on ourself, lets use it with some awareness. Lets watch ourself as we use it; then something will begin to awaken within us.</font> At first it will be very fragile. Thus as awareness first develops, we may want to maintain our discipline just as you would keep a wire fence around a small sapling to protect it. But once the dreamer is fully awake, all rules and disciplines fall away; they’re just irrelevant now. An awakened being may look disciplined because of a daily routine or rhythm, but that’s just the appearance.

The routine of an awakened person is not a discipline because it’s not something imposed. Rather, it’s a rhythm that has **arisen naturally, spontaneously, by itself**. The Melody is moving unimpeded now in that vessel. The light is on.




## Chapter Thirty-five
Just be natural, the Taoist master Chuang Tzu says.

“When the shoe fits, the foot is forgotten.” He is saying that only when there is struggle or discomfort do we become aware of something. **This is the situation of the mind — continually in a struggle, in a discomfort.** Let’s see the point: How else can it maintain itself? It is the struggle, the discomfort. It has no existence other than that. If we’re just natural, if we’re ordinary, if we’re balanced, there is no place for the mind to stand. It must fall.

To be natural means to be balanced, it means to be in the middle. This is Buddha’s middle way. Mind always wants to go to extremes, so it can keep moving. First we eat too much, then we starve ourself. Or we work very competitively,and then we go to the other side and relax very competitively. Or first we’re a playboy, then we get sick of that and want to become a saint. **The mind tends to move to extremes, it often doesn’t know where or when to stop. This keeps the mind alIive, because by moving to extremes it keeps moving.**

The master is a contrast to that. She’s balanced, like a tight rope walker. She leans neither to the left nor the right;but stays balanced over the center, not going to extremes.

She has a great sense of appropriateness. She’s just easy,ordinary. <font color=red>To be ordinary is a rare quality, for the mind is always trying to be extraordinary.</font> It wants to distinguish itself,it wants to stand out from the crowd. Even humility can serve this purpose — the mind will try to be the most humble. This effort to be unique keeps the mind alIive, but it is absolutely absurd. The universe is so vast. **We’re like *a grain of sand* on the beach trying to stand out from the other grains. Pretty absurd.**

The master knows better; she has seen through such nonsense. She’s natural, she’s easy, she’s light. “**Easy is right**,”says Chuang Tzu. Easy in the beginning, easy in the middle,easy in the end. **The master is effortless, non-serious, playful.** She knows there is nothing to do, so everything she does is“nothing special.”

She just does what she’s doing — without compulsion,without attachment. It’s a good test: <font color=red>Does what we’re doing feel aligned *deep down*, regardless of what’s happening on the surface? If not, the message may be that we’re fighting the river somehow.</font> The mind can make a tension even out of easiness by making a rule out of it. “Be easy.” This won't work. So how do we become easy?

```
deep down 在内心深处，在心底（知道）
```

Actually, mind cannot ever really be easy and relaxed because it’s always trying to change or control things. Just look: The Existence is vast, infinite, incomprehensible — and we are going to change it? **We know better than God how things should go?** We make war on Reality — especially in our mind — and then wonder why life seems so difficult.

Since the mind finds it difficult to relax, one device is to use the mind against the mind, to use the mind to go further into doingness. By pushing the pendulum to an extreme —heavy physical exertion, *primal therapy*, sustained dancing,etc. — the pendulum automatically swings back to the otherside and a silence ensues. In that silence, awareness can arise.

```
primal therapy 原始疗法
```

Awareness is the true road to easiness. All devices —concentration, meditations, therapies, austerities, *martial arts*,whatever — are only to create situations where awareness can begin to arise, where the dreamer can begin to awaken. We can go on cutting a few leaves off the tree in our life, trying to improve this or that, but the leaves just keep growing back. Or we can cut the root.

```
austerities 苦行;禁欲;
martial arts 武术
```

Jesus said, “I bring a sword.” It’s all very well to love everything, but sometimes we need a sword too, in this sense:Sometimes when we’re sitting for long periods in meditation,“just sitting,” we need to face the fear or the anxiety or the boredom and just not move. <font color=red>Just be unmoving in the face of those things that we’ve always moved away from before.</font>

The sword that actually cuts the root of the mind is this unflinching awareness. What we’re doing, the lifestyle we’re leading, the methods we’re using are of little importance. Awareness of what we’re doing is the key. For awareness leads to silence, and silence in turn leads to deeper awareness; at bottom, they are the same. Awakening is going so far into the present moment that you can’t get back out.




## Chapter Thirty-six
Watch. We’ll see that <font color=red>we create our version of reality by what our attention is focused on.</font> “The floor.” We just created the floor by bringing our attention and energy to it.

What is the difference between attention and awareness? Simply that **attention is directed, focused, while awareness is non-directed, passive.** One way of putting it is that <font color=red>**awareness is noticing what we notice**</font>. It’s noticing the labels,discriminations, responses, models, activities, evaluations and demands that constitute our version of reality.

And as awareness develops, it becomes obvious that we are entirely responsible for the reality that we live in, because it’s our version of it. God is not responsible. The world is not responsible. We are responsible. Our experience of reality is our own creation.

<font color=red>The world is a perfect echo of us</font>. It is like standing in a canyon. If we shout “God!” we’ll hear “God!” back. If we shout “Hate!” we’ll hear “Hate!” back. We hear our own projections. The river mirrors our own struggles. For instance,the qualities that annoy us about others are projections of qualities that we ourselves have. Otherwise, we would notice them but they wouldn’t have any charge for us.

If arrogance in someone bothers us it’s because we’re arrogant. If resentment in someone bothers us it’s because we have resentment. Otherwise it would make no impression on us, it would be irrelevant, it would have no more significance than the ceiling. The canyon echos us. And this is true in the widest sense. If the world seems violent, let’s look within at ourself. What is violent in us?

All this being so, **if we truly want to help the world then we can work on ourself. <font color=red>That is where it starts and ends</font>.** If we want to improve someone else then we can work on ourself. We’ll be surprised — as our own consciousness is raised we’ll find that the other person has “improved.” They are much more okay now. A miracle!

As our consciousness deepens we gradually find that we are living in a different reality. **The game is to work on ourself — not on others, not on the world.** The mind always finds wrongness and problems out there and then wants to solve them there, but the mind has created the wrongness and the problems in the first place. How can we ever solve something externally which is being created internally?

```
吾心即是宇宙，宇宙即是吾心。
```

A special trap is taking any of the concepts discussed here and using them to make others wrong. For example, **if we point out to someone that they are running a tape, we are the one who is running a tape — about them**. We are the one who is missing. In our universe, we are the person who has the opportunity to get off it. And there is no way to get off it and still be right. Working on other people is a good way to stay stuck in the mind. Let’s work on ourselves.

Does this mean that we never communicate how we feel if we're upset about something? Does it mean that we don’t ever correct “wrongness” if we feel that something can be constructively done? No. **The mind is always looking for rules with which to achieve certainty, but no rule is always appropriate.**

<font color=red>Let’s be a witness to ourselves. What stories or tapes are we running now? How are we creating our experience of the situation?</font> As Ken Keyes said, first become centered and then act. When we’re uncentered and upset in any way we’ll tend to create turbulence and disharmony whatever we do or say. So let’s let our *primary emphasis* always be our own consciousness. **Let’s slowly fall silent inside**.

```
浊以静之徐清。
```

**When we’re silent inside we’ll naturally, spontaneously do whatever is most appropriate, whatever might create the greatest overall harmony. There won’t be a decision involved,no rule to follow. It will happen of itself. We will literally beliving in a different reality, and the world will look entirely different to us, even though it’s entirely the same. What used to be problems will no longer be problems.**

So let’s not try to solve problems while staying attached to our stories. **Our individual problems are not the problem. The world’s problems are not the problem. <font color=red>A lack of consciousness is the only real “problem” in this world.</font>**

Always, our first priority can be to be more conscious of our stories about how others and this world and ourselves ought to be different — and how those stories are creating our sense of isolation and suffering.

**When we become more silent within it will all begin to work. We’ll experience the perfection of Existence, <font color=red>not as a concept but as an experiential reality</font>. Nothing will be seen as a problem, not even death. For when we’re really silent we’re gone, we are no more; we have joined Existence Itself. The drop has merged in the ocean.**

How then can death trouble us? Death is a problem to the mind, to “you” and “I.” How can disease or pain or loss or poverty or suffering or anything at all trouble us when we nolonger exist? Only the Ocean exists, and It’s not troubled. All we ever were was the disturbance, the mind’s movement. When that is gone, we too are gone. And so is death.

When we’re silent within we’ll be spontaneously loving and compassionate; we will be love, we will be compassion,but there will be no thought of “love” or “compassion.” It will just happen. And when we communicate with someone we won’t be dumping our tapes and justifications and blame on them, but simply sharing our experience.

Sharing is being responsible for our experience — “I had a thought just now that you’re conceited and I turned it around and saw how I’m conceited when I’m thinking that about you.” Dumping is when we put the responsibility for our experience out there — “You know, you’re conceited!”

Dumping activates the automatic mechanisms of others and creates conflict and estrangement. Sharing creates a communion; it makes us real to others, it makes us available. Then we’re not trying to protect anything, for example our story, for we’ve seen that there’s nothing to protect.

```
Sharing & Dumping
```

The mind always feels that certain things need to be protected for the sake of our survival. But what is really being protected? Yes, the mind itself, the survival programming itself. To the extent that we’re willing to share ourself with others, to that extent we weaken the hold of the mind and open up space with others instead of shutting it down. And we’ll see more and more that what we are protecting isn’t worth protecting, and conversely, that what is really worth protecting — **the vast pregnant spaciousness and emptiness** within that we really are — needs no protection at all.




## Chapter Thirty-seven
The person of final awakening is like the open sky. She is boundless, infinite. **The bodily form is merely a contact point with Existence itself.** And like the sky, her true dwelling place has no walls, no roof and no floor either. How to protect a dwelling place that has no structure and no location?

The liberated person has a body-mind package but she is not that package; she is the void, the emptiness out of which that package has arisen. How to protect an absence, a void? Since it cannot be harmed, there is no need to protect it and no possibility of protecting it. Consequently, **the person of awakening is totally open to life, totally transparent, totally receptive to all things.**

She says “yes” to all aspects of life without reservation. **The mind gathers energy and strength by saying “no” to parts of Existence. This is liked and that is disliked. But <font color=red>the person of wisdom says “yes” to all of it. And nothing is excluded, not even the mind</font>.**

For she knows that Existence is a vast mystery which cannot be penetrated. She knows that she knows nothing at all, and so she simply opens her heart. She trusts. She allows the river to carry her, she knows not where, she knows not why. But **with that trusting heart she experiences the bliss of allowing herself to be a part of the flow. Just to exist in each moment is a benediction.**

He has no attachment to particular concepts or beliefs,and so he’s willing to let others have them. He’s willing to let others be “right.” After all, each concept is part of Existence too, it is perfect in its own way. And **each person is a part of Existence, a part of God — so the divine is speaking through everyone.**

He sometimes uses the master Mahavir's logic when it’s appropriate. If someone makes a statement of some kind his attitude toward it might be, “Perhaps you are right.” He lets the other person know that he understood what was said, but he’s lost the compulsion to agree or disagree — least of all with philosophical or metaphysical systems. He’s receptive to all things large and small, including all concepts, but he’s not attached to any. He <font color=red>plays with them as what they are — toys in the sandbox</font>.

He has abandoned trying to know the how or why of Existence or of his situation, he’s abandoned gathering facts and data and answers and solutions. He’s willing to play with data and questions and so on, but doesn't take them seriously because he has accepted his complete ignorance.

Ultimately, Existence is unknown and unknowable. It is wild, mysterious, infinite, unboxable. The mind keeps trying to box it up and *pin it down*, but it isn’t boxable or pinnable. We can pin the butterfly down, but then it’s not a butterfly anymore; it’s dead.

Only the trusting heart really sees. As the fox said to the little prince, “It is only with the heart that one sees rightly;what is essential is invisible to the eye.” Facts, data, boxes do not touch what is essential.

Buddha used to tell a story about a man wounded by a poisoned arrow. His friends and relatives procure a physician to pull out the arrow, but the man says he won’t have the arrow pulled out until he knows the name of the man who wounded him and the name of his clan. And he won’t have the arrow pulled out until he knows the height of the attacker and his village and his race. And he will not have the arrow pulled out until he knows the type of feathers used in the arrow and the type of wood and the type of metal in the tip and many other things. Buddha points out that the man will die in the middle of finding all this out.

This is our situation. **We will die in the middle of collecting our data and answers and goals unless we awaken to our situation.** We might think we can go toward happiness like an arrow going towards the target. We might imagine it is a matter of getting certain things in place.

But <font color=red>aiming directly toward the target can sometimes guarantee that we’ll miss it</font>. For instance, someone lies back in a lake feeling the sun on her face. She’s not trying to accomplish anything; she’s relaxed, surrendered. And a moment may come when bliss descends on her. We hear about it, let’s say,and we go to the lake to find this happiness. We lie back in the lake waiting for the moment of bliss, but it doesn’t come.Why not?

Perhaps because we were direct. We sought directly. But **Existence is indirect. It moves through hints and whispers, It reveals itself through silence.** Only when all seeking is gone and we're willing to wait for all eternity with no striving, no desire, no goal, <font color=red>not waiting for anything in particular but just waiting for no reason — then, in that empty silence, Existence reveals Itself</font>.

The mind thinks it can find happiness, thinks it can find God, thinks it can find enlightenment. But what map will we use? And how can there be a map when there’s no address, no location?

When there is no more seeking after anything at all,when there is **simply waiting with no goal in mind**, then God finds you. The seeker is the sought. You are the goal.




## Chapter Thirty-eight
God finds us when we’re not away from home. But God can come only to us when we’re totally naked. **As long as we are clinging to something in our version of reality, God can’t come to us.** The Unlimited, so to speak, makes contact with us when we’re not clinging to something limited.

Sufis tell a story of blind men feeling an elephant. One feels the trunk and declares that an elephant is curving and long. One feels the ear and announces that an elephant is wide and flat. One feels the tail and concludes that an elephant is like a rope. **As long as we cling to our partial version of things we can never see the Real.**

Another example: Three people walk down the street. One is hungry and notices the different restaurants. One is lustful and notices the appropriate sex objects. One just had a wallet stolen and notices only the thief up ahead. All are on the same street, but all are in different versions of reality.

To see the Real is to be unencumbered by thoughts or desires about part of it; it is to have no identification left with anything partial. And this means to have no attachment even to any concept of God or Existence or enlightenment, because **all concepts whatsoever are partial**.

```
unencumbered [ˌʌnɪnˈkʌmbərd] 无负担的;没有阻碍的;不受妨碍的;没有作为抵押的
```

How can we leave our partial versions of reality behind when we're so mired in them? Awareness does it. We see that they are partial. We see moment-to-moment that our version of things is only a version and that it is not reality itself.

**We observe ourself moment-to-moment — what we are doing, what we are thinking and feeling, how we’re reacting towards this and that.** As this continues, the thoughts of the mind gradually die down, and we begin to notice the gaps between our thoughts like the clouds parting and allowing a glimpse of the sun. Then we begin to enter the Silence where we encounter Existence itself. And one day when the Silence is complete we disappear and then, in this metaphor, God can truly play the divine Song through us.

<font color=red>The ultimate value of awareness, therefore, is that it leads to Silence and Stillness within us</font>. And in that Stillness,Existence is. God arises. The Self is “born.” Existence, Self —whatever the name — was always there but wasn’t noticed because of the incessant activity, the incessant static of the mind’s beliefs and clutchings.

Silence then, as Ramana Maharshi once said, is the true instruction. There’s no teacher like Silence. It is incomparable. Mind is like the surface of a lake when one is trying to see into the depths. When the surface is choppy and agitated, the depths cannot be seen. Once the surface is still and silent,though, the depths can be seen easily. They were always there but could not be observed.

The value of concentration meditations — focusing on an object such as a mantra, an image, a koan, the breath, and so on — is that they can still the waves of the mind and thus give a taste of Silence. However, the effect is only temporary.The mind is being suppressed, that’s all; it does not fall, it is not extinguished. Concentrations are an activity of the mind,they are the mind suppressing and drugging itself. They’re a form of getting high, and so we have to gradually come down when the concentration ends.

**Concentration is an active awareness and not the true,passive awareness. Instead of being an effortless witness to the flow of leaves down the river, concentration is focusing on a particular leaf. It is attached rather than detached, of the mind rather than the Self.** Concentration is thinking, it is the mind addressed in some particular direction. Yet it can be a useful device. It can give a glimpse through the door. And its power of focus can assist our awareness in going deeper.

But true meditation is awareness — passive, choiceless awareness, the witness. It is this which can still the waves forever, which can uncover Silence permanently. It is through awareness that a moment can happen from which there is no slipping back, no coming down.

For only through awareness can one see **the illusory nature of the mind and its survival-oriented thinking.** Only through awareness can we awaken and see that the mind is not actually there, that the tapes are simply what they are and not reality, that the mind as self-determiner does not exist,that the “I” does not exist, that all the grasping and seeking and judgments and a version concerning the problems of life are the problem itself.

Only through awareness can we see that **at the deepest level there is nowhere to go, that the goingness itself was the problem, that this moment is all there ever is and that being aware is what there is to “do” with it.**

Beyond this awakening, however, is **a final awakening where we simply disappear**. This is the final extinguishment of all qualities that we’ve thought of as ourself. It is total Silence and Stillness, the final annihilation of all thoughts, tapes, programs, desires, disturbances. We can use thoughts, of course,but it is like picking up a ruler to draw a line. When there is no more use for the ruler, it is laid down; there is simply. Silence, Spaciousness.

**Then we have attained to being a nobody, a nothing.** Now rivers flow in us, stars are born in us, the wind blows through the trees in us. There is the bliss of Existence Itself, a bliss which transcends what is normally thought of as joy and happiness in human life.

In this state of final awakening, <font color=red>**everything that would have to be given up at physical death has already been given up before physical death**</font>. The body is still alIive, but now there is no inhabitant anymore. This awakening, therefore, is truly a dying. **It is death. Not bodily death, but the death of “you”or “I,” the death of the mind, the illusory controller.**

It’s the death of everything we’ve ever associated with“you” or “I.” Everything has been thrown, nothing is carried any longer. The luggage full of stories and tapes and desires has been put down forever. We leave behind all our burdens,including the ultimate burden — the separate “I.”

Now death has no hold anymore. Death is dead, for we have already died. In that death we are reborn, but it is not us. Now we are not, but God is. **God has been “born” through our absence. The Existence lives and breathes through the vessel now. It’s like the open sky — eternal, deathless.**

The Existence expresses through a human form. Then we are Everything and Nothing. We are Oneness and the Void. Who we are now was never born, so it cannot die. Both life and death have been transcended. Such a person, as Jesus said, is in the world but not of it anymore. And the Ocean itself rises in the wave.




## Chapter Thirty-nine
Is an innocent young infant in this state? Is an animal enlightened? In one sense they are because there is no mind,there is no rational-controller. There is no problem about life because there is no past or future, no expectations or models,no concepts or comparisons. There is just life from moment to moment. On the other hand there is strong instinctual, lower-brain programming to survive and avoid extinction. **In contrast, an awakened being has no desire to seek or avoid extinction, because the separate “I” has already become extinct.**

But this isn’t the crux of the matter. What about a cloud or *a blade of* grass? Now there is no desire even to survive.There is simply the bliss of perfect harmony with Existence. Are they enlightened? No.. .and now we come to the heart of it.

There is no possibility of a cloud or a leaf or a wave awakening because they aren’t conscious. Only humans — or any other sentient beings — can become **self-realized**, for only sentient beings are conscious. **Only humans or other sentient beings have the capability to experience the hell of consciousness, the hell of mind — and that is what we do experience.** But this hell also contains the seeds of another possibility.

```
the hell of mind
```

To be conscious means to be split, to be divided. The mind is always trying to be somewhere other than where it is. The conscious mind is pulling in one direction and the unconscious conditioning is pulling in another. Or the desire system wan‘ts something other than the Reality herenow. One is not whole. This is the anguish, the tension of mind.

As Osho says, entities who don’t have sentience have no tension because they’re unconscious; then there is no problem. And the free being has no tension because they are conscious completely; then there is no problem either. Only we humans and other sentient beings are partial; **only we live in the hell of being divided**. But this partial consciousness means also the possibility is there of becoming completely conscious.

**Awakening means first going to hell and then coming back to paradise**. Liberation means first battling and struggling with the river and then seeing the illusion and ceasing the struggle... through awareness, through silence, through the extinguishing of who we think we are.

The tragedy of the human is that only he or she truly suffers. No animal, no plant, no river can suffer as humans do because there is no mind to struggle, no mind to live in the past and future, no mind to compare and judge and crave. **Self-realization has depth to it because it has first known the misery of mind.**

```
作为一个有自我意识的人，从mind的幻象中清醒，“复其初”。
```

This is why a fetus, even though existing in bliss, isn’t awakened — it is not yet conscious. **One must pass through the pain of partial consciousness before the doors of heaven can open in complete consciousness.**

And then deliverance is here, in this life. In one sense,the pathless path to awakening can be considered a regression back through the history of the organism to life in the womb. As awareness deepens, we go back through a psychodynamic stage, bringing consciousness to and disappearing the tapes formed by painful and traumatic incidents in childhood.

```
psychodynamic [ˌsaɪkoʊdaɪˈnæmɪk] 心理动力;精神动力学;精神动力;以心理动力学;精神动态
```

Then as awareness increases further we undergo a kind of birthing stage, confronting the human condition of pain and suffering, dying and death and the desire for survival —corresponding to the agony of the fetus as it dies as a fetus inorder to be born.

Finally, as awareness becomes complete, one goes back to a transpersonal reality. The fetus is in undisturbed peace,undisturbed bliss. It has no sense of “I,” no desires, no urge to get somewhere, to control. It simply is, and there is no problem whatever. The awakened person is like this, but there is a crucial difference — where as the fetus is unconscious, the self-realized person is totally conscious. Both are in bliss, both have no identity, no mind, but one is conscious and the other is not. To have no mind, no ego, no disturbance within, yet to be fully conscious — this is liberation.

How do we reach it? “You” and “I” can never reach it because we are the obstacle. **Only when we disappear can it be reached.** Indeed, the moment we are not, It is already there. But **we cannot attain to our own non-existence**; there is noway for us to reach that, for the very attempt to reach keeps “us” in existence. **All that can be done is to cultivate the ground — and then it happens of its own accord**.

Existence does it. It’s like the farmer growing his crop. He tills the soil, plants the seeds and then waits. He must have great patience. By and by, Existence Itself brings the crop up out of the soil. Yet the farmer also makes a contribution. And when awakening happens it’s clearly a grace bestowed by the Whole; there is clearly no doer except the Totality. And yet we contribute too, by tilling the ground.

And how is the ground tilled? How is the seed planted? Through the non-doingness of awareness, mindfulness. But awareness can only become fully mature in perfect silence and stillness. So like the farmer, we set aside periods of just sitting silently and waiting. Unlike the farmer, though, we wait not for anything in particular, but for nothing at all.

We are just waiting. Waiting with an open heart, with a trusting heart. **We can reach a point where even the goal or concept of awakening is no longer there, where we’re prepared to just wait with no end or goal for all eternity.** We can reach the point where time drops away from us, when we see our own uselessness, when we see that the world is doing just fine without us and that we’ve been discarded, thrown on the junk pile. **Only when time drops from us completely has the mind also dropped.**

We cultivate then **the greatest art, the art of just sitting silently**. But sitting silently in great awakeness, consciousness,awareness. **It’s simply stopping, it is simply coming to a halt. It’s allowing the waves of the mind to subside, it’s allowing the bicycle to come to a stop and then just topple over. It is the ultimate in doing nothing.**
And in that absence Existence reveals Itself.
The Zen master Zenrin said:
**Sitting silently, doing nothing,**
**Spring comes and the grass grows by itself.**
**Sitting silently, doing nothing, we imperceptibly merge into a harmony with the Existence... which is not trying to get anywhere, which is not trying to accomplish anything, which is simply the bliss of being what It is.**

```
imperceptibly 极微地；微细地；察觉不到地; 不知不觉地
```




## Chapter Forty
**Sitting silently, doing nothing, waiting for nothing, just waiting — with no end in view, with no goals or desires or attachments, simply being silent and aware.. .this is how the final awakening comes.**

In our ordinary life the mind pulls away from boredom because it needs excitement to stay alIive. It knows only two possibilities, movement or sleeping. If nothing is going on the mind is just bored, it wants to go to sleep. But **sitting silently,doing nothing is a third possibility — consciousness without occupation**.

It is the ultimate facing of boredom. It is going deeper and deeper into the boredom, into the emptiness, into the hollowness beneath all the onion-layers of the mind. It is penetrating deeper into tedium, into silence, into nothing, into lack of stimulation.

It can be done with eyes closed or open-and-unmoving,it makes no difference. The body is put into a relaxed position where it can be still for awhile. And then the essential thing is that we are no longer moving in a particular direction or dimension but are open to all dimensions, all directions.. .open to whatever is happening, open to the Totality.

An interesting metaphor:
Wakefulness is consciousness plus mental activity. Deepsleep is neither, it is unconsciousness plus mental inactivity. Dreams are activity without consciousness. But silent, open,aware sitting is the most interesting of all — it’s **consciousness without activity**. Appropriately enough, silent sitting is the opposite of dreaming.

In one sense, **this final awakening could be described as being in a state of deep sleep while being fully conscious**. In the normal waking state of the brain, beta waves of 14-26 cycles per second predominate. In the deep relaxation brought about by various concentration meditations we pass down to alpha waves of 8-13 cycles per second.

Then it was discovered that Zen monks who are experienced in mindfulness meditation pass down while remaining conscious to theta waves of 4-7 cycles per second, which are normally present only during the medium stages of sleep. And awakening might then be characterized as remaining fully conscious while passing down to delta waves of 0-4 cycles persecond, which are normally present only during the deepeststage of sleep.

Deep sleep is very beautiful. In deep sleep there are nothoughts, no desires, no tapes, no stories. There is no struggle,no striving. In deep sleep we are not a particular identity; infact, we are not anything at all, our identity is gone. There is no clinging, no mind, no “I.” On the other hand, there is no consciousness either. Freedom is adding consciousness to this state of inner stillness, and living in the world with it.

It is awareness without attachment, consciousness without an object. The only difference between ourselves and a Buddha, then, is that we have something that the Buddha doesn’t have. The Buddha merely has consciousness. We have consciousness plus stories and dreams. **Final liberation is the complete disappearance of all stories of the mind.**

In this state every moment of life is a benediction, a natural gratitude for the overwhelming loveliness and majesty of life. Every moment is a spontaneous prayer, a spontaneous surrender to Existence itself. But there is no decision to do or be these things, for there’s no one to make the decision. There is simply emptiness, open sky, and in that emptiness those qualities are just there.

There is bliss because all is as it should be: It’s perfect,It’s exactly the way It is. In a cloud, a leaf, an animal, a person is seen the Eternal, the Deathless, the Nameless. The face of the unfathomable Mystery is present everywhere.

```
unfathomable  [ʌnˈfæðəməbl] 深不可测
```

**The whole universe is seen in a river or a blade of grass,and yet, there’s no one to see it. It is the Existence Itself now who sees.** The old inhabitant and all her sufferings is gone;now God is the only inhabitant. God looks out at God. God sings a song to God. Infinity can be held in the palm of the hand. Less has become more, for there is a grace over the most mundane details of daily life, or over nothing at all.

```
一花一世界,一叶一菩提。
```

There is a kind of great drunkenness with life — but no drunkard, for no one is there. There is nobody, nothing. There is simply bliss, peace, grace, enchantment for no reason, nocause. It’s just the quality of the Mystery.

```
enchantment [ɪnˈtʃæntmənt] 魅力
```

In this state life is like the notes of a symphony, in Alan Watts’ great metaphor. There is no attempt to get to the end of anything, for each moment is the whole point. Each note is precious, perfect, needed, complete in itself.

The purpose of all of Reality is now gathered into each timeless instant, the eternal present.

Life is now like listening to the rain — each drop of rain a brilliant jewel, the scripture of Existence. There is only the rain, the sound of the rain, the suchness of the rain. There is no mind, no awakening, no awareness, no listener. There is no anything anymore. All things have merged into emptiness,the void.. .Nothing. Now there is only the pat-pat-pat of the rain itself, vanishing into silence.



# Afterword

The true revolution is always the same. It lies not in attempting to change things to the way our mind wants them to be, but in waking up to find ourselves in love with the way they are. Theres no logic to it; its an illogical falling in love with all of Reality as It is. Its waking up from the dream-sleep of stories and attachments we normally call being awake.

To do this great attentiveness is needed. This brings the transformation. Actually, such mindful awareness is itself the transformation, for nothing additional needs to be done. In that pure fire, certain things will drop away. All things will become new even as we change nothing.

```
attentiveness 注意力；专注
```

But this mindfulness is subtle. **The difference between running the tapes of the mind and watching them as they run is microscopic, a hair’s breadth. Yet that difference ultimately is very vast.** In other words, it takes a lot of alertness to be alert. And if you’re like me, you’ll forget over and over.

It’s good to allow ourselves some time each day to sit silently, to be aware in silence. In effect, we just sit on the bank and watch the mud in the pond begin to settle by itself — for that is its natural tendency when it isn’t being continuously stirred up by the mind’s motion.

We don’t need to be unduly concerned about the “right”posture, schedule or technique. An undue concern would just create more tension. **There are many useful devices, such as verbalizing our watching or mentally sweeping the body, but ultimately they have to be allowed to drop or they become part of the obstacle.** Ultimately, awareness has to stand completely on its own. Since it is your unique journey, the natural rhythms that are right for you will eventually find you.

As the mind quiets down — or perhaps more accurately,as it becomes more absent — the infinite Mystery, the **undying Intelligence** will manifest more and more within us. We can’t ever leave It, for It is us, yet paradoxically we journey far afield before awareness or total exhaustion allows us to discover that we have always been home.

I am also on this journeyless journey with you. For all of us, there is no limit to how far we can walk into this limitless,mysterious Ocean that is ourselves.

On this journey to yourself, this pathless path that leads to where you are — to where “you” aren't — may you experience much love. And may you experience the peace that passes all understanding.

## 第一章
这是一个真实的故事。
故事的主人公是世界征服者亚历山大大帝和犬儒学派哲学家第欧根尼。第欧根尼于公元前 4 世纪住在雅典，他身无长物，仅有一个讨饭碗，有一天，他把这个也扔掉了。当时，第欧根尼因内心平和、幸福而闻名。亚历山大大帝听说过他，渴望与他相见。

这是一次历史上颇有趣味的会面。当亚历山大大帝走近时，第欧根尼正在河边晒太阳。亚历山大看着那双宁静而满足的眼睛，告诉第欧根尼他非常钦佩他，然后问他是否有什么可以为他做的。

第欧根尼思索片刻后说：“是的，有件事你可以为我做。你可以稍微挪到旁边一点，你挡着阳光了。”

这是一个既怪异又美丽的回答。当时世界上最强大的人愿意为他做任何事，而第欧根尼却只让他不要挡住阳光。**这是一个一无所需的人。**

亚历山大大帝说：“当我征服世界后，我会来和你一起在河边休息。”

第欧根尼回答道：“你不必先征服世界。我没有征服世界，我正在休息。**有什么阻碍着你呢？你现在就可以休息。**”

亚历山大大帝说：“不，我必须先征服世界。”于是第欧根尼对他说：“你永远无法完成。你会在中途死去。”而亚历山大大帝也确实如此，在一次战争中死去。

<font color=red>这就是我们的大脑，总是觉得必须先做完某件事才能放松</font>。事实上，大脑永远无法放松，因为它始终处于忙碌状态。大脑的毛病就是永不停歇。如果大脑停止忙碌，它就会不复存在。它就像一条鲨鱼，必须不停游动才能呼吸。**一旦停止游动，大脑就会死亡**。

甚至说它会死亡都不准确，因为大脑本身就是不断的活动。它并非鲨鱼，而是活动本身。**当活动停止时，大脑早已消失，因为它从未真正存在过。** 但大脑的这种持续活动让它看起来似乎存在。

那么，大脑究竟在忙些什么呢？

它忙于思考、情绪、感觉、欲望、目标、问题、偏好、活动等等。所有被说出、做出、感受到或想到的东西都属于大脑。这一切都是大脑的活动，而大脑始终处于运动之中。可以把大脑比作一场舞蹈。没有运动就无所谓舞蹈，一旦运动停止，舞蹈也就结束了。

表面上看，我们的生活中似乎存在许多问题。但大师们说，其实只有一个问题：大脑。他们指出，**唯有这一个问题**，如果解决了它，所有其他问题就会瞬间消失，因为它们本就源于大脑问题本身。大师们说，**正是大脑制造了我们所有的烦恼**，如果不解决大脑这个根本问题，无论我们解决多少问题，新的问题都会不断涌现。

这就像是在砍树的叶子，我们逐一解决问题，却又惊讶地发现，每砍掉一片叶子，就有三片新叶长出来。每个园丁都知道，修剪树枝能让树木更茂盛。因此，我们每解决一个问题，就会出现其他问题，这个过程永无止境。我们在这无尽的问题解决中疲惫不堪。

如果我们深入探究，就会发现这个过程永远不会结束，新的叶子总会不断生长。所以我们不应只关注枝叶，而要关注树根——大脑，因为这才是问题的根源。只有斩断树根，所有叶子才会同时枯萎。

因此，让我们 <font color=red>关注树根</font>，而不是枝叶。让我们 <font color=red>审视大脑的本质</font>。



## 第二章
这是什么本质呢？<font color=red>心灵的本质就是永远在追寻、渴望</font>。它是一个追求者，一个设定目标的机制。**它总是在试图到达某个地方，这就是它从未活在当下的原因**。看看我们对自己的说话方式：“一旦我找到合适的伴侣，一切就会好起来。”“等我拿到新的加薪，我就可以放松了。”“等房子扩建完成，我就能真正享受生活了。”“等我解决了这个问题，我就会快乐了。”

我们的心灵总是活在未来，却从未活在当下。幸福总是一个稍远的目标，会在问题解决后实现。但我们有没有注意到？一旦一个问题解决了，其他问题又出现了。一旦一个目标达成，新的目标又出现了。这必然如此，因为心灵是一个目标追寻者。没有目标，没有渴望，它就无法存在。它必须有行动，它必须有东西去追求，这就是它的本质。

那么，我们可能会问，<font color=red>对心灵来说，什么是问题呢？</font>问题就是心灵无法接受的任何事物。**它是心灵渴望某事与现状不同的欲望**。它是某种与心灵对局势本应如何的模型不一致的情况。

**如果我们没有任何渴望让事物与现状不同，那就没有问题**。但心灵总是有一份它希望不同的事物清单，因此它总是有许多问题需要解决。这使它保持忙碌，也使它保持“活着”。

心灵最终在解决什么问题呢？<font color=red>它的终极问题是死亡</font>。心灵不想被消灭，而且<font color=red>它始终处于恐惧之中</font>，因为它知道死亡可能随时降临。如果我们深入内心，我们可以看到一种颤抖、一种紧张——对消灭的恐惧。**心灵一直在努力解决如何生存的问题**。它的目标是找到一种方法，让自己永远存在下去。

为了缓解这种内心的恐惧，心灵试图积累更多的安全感、权力和快乐。心灵变成了一个收藏家。它收集更多的地位、声望、财富和财产。它收集更多的知识、更多的数据、更多的答案。它收集更多的感觉，然后又是更多的感觉。更多的食物、更多的性、更多的冒险。更多的伴侣、朋友或盟友。更多的技术。更多的房子、汽车、衣服或书籍，更多的体验、更多的解决方案。**我们每个人都不一样，但每个人都渴望得到更多的某样东西。这是心灵的本质**。

但无论收集多少，无论积累多少，都无法满足内心的恐惧和颤抖，因为<font color=red>所有的收集都是外在的，而恐惧和颤抖是内在的</font>。外在的东西永远无法满足内在的需求。这就是为什么心灵如此贪婪。它不断积累，希望填补内心的空虚，但它永远无法填满，因此它继续积累、渴望、追寻。这场游戏永无止境，直到死亡的那一天。**我们总是在中途死去——在得到我们想要的东西的中途**。




## 第三章
心智常被比作一只醉酒的猴子在树林中穿梭，因为它的活动从未停息。看看猴子，它总是在做些什么。它动来动去，抓痒，吃东西，四处张望；只有在睡觉时才会停下来。再看看我们的心思，它们也具有同样的特质。<font color=red>我们的心智在事物之间不停地跳跃。</font>“这张桌子……是硬木做的……它来自哪里？……我想是俄勒冈州……我在想住在那里的生活会是什么样子……听说那里经常下雨……我们这里最近确实很少下雨……农民们需要些雨水……种地的生活真不容易……”思绪就这样不断延续。

持续不断的思绪表现为持续不断的活动。即使在放松的时候，我们往往也处于某种活动中：嚼口香糖、翻阅杂志、听收音机、做饭、吃零食、阅读、看电视。对于心智来说，问题总是：“接下来是什么？”于是我们从吃饭到聊天，到工作，到做爱，到阅读，到看电影，到去海滩，再到吃饭，再到参加派对……永无止境。

“接下来是什么？”心智得到片刻的满足，但随后那瞬间就过去了，心智又想要更多。它又得到了，但那也过去了；然后它又想要更多，无穷无尽。<font color=red>心智永远无法活在当下，因为对心智来说，当下只是达到目的的手段。</font>

这就是心智本质上总是处于痛苦之中的原因，因为<font color=red>它永远无法停留在当下的这一刻。</font>

<font color=red>我们心中关于应该做什么的画面是基于过去的记忆</font>。它利用过去试图抵达未来。由于心智总是处于过去或未来之中，它必然大部分时间都处于痛苦之中。

<font color=red>痛苦只是另一种从未活在当下、总是处于别处的代名词</font>。痛苦被压抑下去，以免我们察觉太多，但它始终存在。即使我们看似感觉良好，内心深处的痛苦依然潜藏。

看起来我们似乎活在当下，但实际上我们几乎从未真正如此。如果我们在洗碗，我们并不是单纯地在洗碗。我们首先设定了一个短期目标，可能自己都没有意识到——那就是完成洗碗。我们希望通过洗碗达成某种成就。

与此同时，我们的脑海中闪过千百个念头：鲍勃昨天说的话……我们今晚要吃的晚餐……哦，植物需要浇水……凯莉真漂亮……但她总是把房间温度调得太高……如此这般。我们还被去年洗碗时烫伤手的记忆重新激活。我们并不在当下。

心智永远无法真正地玩耍，因为<font color=red>玩耍是当下的，它没有过去或未来</font>。享受乐趣就是去做某件事而不带任何目标，既不是为了追求快乐，也不是为了完成它。它只是玩耍、嬉戏；它没有任何目的。

<font color=red>真正的玩耍对心智来说是不可理解的</font>，因为对心智来说，一切事物都必须有目的，必须服务于某种目标，必须有意义。否则，那有什么意义呢？但<font color=red>乐趣和玩耍本身没有意义，这就是它们的意义。它们就是它们自己。</font>

奥修讲过一个故事，讲的是一位擅长射箭的求道者。他几乎每次都能射中靶心。他去日本向一位射箭大师学习，希望从他那里获得证书。在日本，人们用各种借口来教授冥想，射箭就是其中之一。求道者一次次射中靶心，但大师只是说：“**现在是你在射箭。但箭应该自己射出去。**”

这听起来很荒谬。箭怎么可能自己射出去呢？求道者继续射中靶心。然后他试图故意射不中靶心，但也不行。大师说：“靶心不是靶心。<font color=red>你才是靶心。</font>”<font color=red>大师并不关心结果，他关心的是开始。</font>

求道者没能从大师那里获得证书，三年后他放弃了，收拾行李准备回家。他去向正在射箭场上的大师告别。

求道者坐下来观看，此时他不再关心证书，他已经放下了。他第一次真正看到了大师。<font color=red>大师只是在享受乐趣，没有人关心是否射中靶心。</font>于是求道者拿起弓，拉开了箭。他不再焦虑，<font color=red>他只是在玩耍</font>。箭还没离弦，大师就转过身去说：“完成了。靶心已经达到了。”

在内心深处，我们的心智总是很严肃，总是努力去达成目标。<font color=red>心智无法理解目标其实就在眼前</font>，因为它的本质就是不断努力去达成目标。

因此，心智几乎总是处于挣扎和努力之中。它总是在努力，陷入困难和障碍之中。

心智从未意识到<font color=red>这种无尽的追求才是真正的问题</font>。它从未意识到，<font color=red>它试图寻找解决方案的努力正是阻碍它看到无需解决方案的真相的动作。</font>这就像一个泥泞的池塘，我们在池塘中搅动泥水以清理泥巴，但正是这种搅动让水保持浑浊，阻止我们看到水面之下的神秘底部。




## 第四章
心灵向其所有目标运动的基础是分别。<font color=red>世界是一个整体，但心灵通过其标签、概念、分类将其分割为多个部分</font>。心灵是一个贴标签者，它给一切事物贴上标签。“这是树，那是篱笆。这是在动的，那是静止的。这是红色的，那是橙色的。他穿着得体，她很普通。男孩长得帅气，他的父亲却不。今天是阴天，太糟糕了，昨天还是晴天。”

<font color=red><b>心灵通过其构建的概念和理论来感知现实，而不是直接感知</b></font>。实验表明，当一个人看到一张红色的黑桃A时，他会看到红心A，因为他有一个概念，认为红色意味着红心或方块。其他实验表明，如果通过预先安排，一群人都声称看到了不存在的东西，那么未经提示的观察者也会看到它。他们会真正看到不存在的东西，因为心灵计算出它必须存在。

事实上，所有标签，<font color=red>所有概念都创造了对立</font>。为了创造“树”这一类别，我们必须同时创造“非树”这一类别，即所有不是树的东西。否则，“树”这一类别就没有意义。我们的所有分类都是如此。“上”没有“下”就没有意义。某物只有相对于另一件“下”的事物，才能是“上”。这两个概念是同时产生的。**现实中不存在“上”或“下”**。这些标签是心灵的创造。

同样，“美”离不开“丑”。“善”离不开“恶”。这都是心灵的创造。**心灵的体验由其理论决定，反过来又强化了这些理论**。

通过某种体验，我们建立了一个信念，比如说，认为留胡子的男人是不礼貌的。我们发现每一个留胡子的男人都符合这一规则。我们带着这种预期进入每一个场景，然后我们发现自己是对的。

心灵不惜一切代价都要证明自己是对的，因为**心灵是一系列观点的集合**。因此，证明其观点的正确性等同于生存。然后，当我们遇到一个留胡子但并不无礼的男人时，我们仍然是对的，因为他变成了“证明规则的例外”。而一旦他犯了错，我们就会说：“看吧？我就知道我是对的。留胡子的男人是不礼貌的。”<font color=red>心灵生活在它自己的现实中</font>。

有一个哈西德故事讲的就是这个道理。有一位哈西德大师，成为了一名法官。因为他非常有觉知，所以并不关心自己是否正确，而是看到一切事物的正确性。第一个案件出现了，法官听了原告的陈述后说：“对。你说得对。”

法庭书记员把他拉到一边说：“你疯了吗？你只听了一方的陈述，怎么能判定它是对的？”法官说：“你说得对。让我们听听被告的陈述。”听完被告的陈述后，法官说：“是的，对。你说得完全正确。”书记员再次把法官拉到一边说：“现在你疯了。你做了你绝对不应该做的事情，你让双方都对了。”法官说：“当然，你说得对。双方怎么可能都对呢？”

这与心灵的做法完全相反。<font color=red>心灵紧紧抓住自己的观点，紧紧抓住自己的正确性。心灵是一个执着者</font>。一旦它开始分别，它就开始偏爱一样东西胜过另一样。它从整体中创造出多样性，然后开始在多样性中挑选和选择。它偏爱棕榈树胜过松树，或者反之。它偏爱蓝色胜过红色，或者高个子女人胜过矮个子女人，或者大房子胜过小房子，或者声望胜过耻辱，或者别的什么。欲望由此产生。

现在，当下的存在已经不够了。现在，必须获得某样东西，当下才会变得足够。还必须推开别的东西。心灵执着于它所喜欢的东西，试图避开它所不喜欢的东西。它依附于自己的欲望、偏好、观点、信念和目标。它依附于人、财产、金钱、权力、青春。它依附于特定的解决方案、答案、仪式、习惯的态度、行为方式和事物应有的模式。心灵变得像一根死去的木棍一样脆弱和僵硬。**它失去了生命的灵活性，变得内心死去**。但它仍然执着，因为它将其等同于生存。

<font color=red>心灵所持有的最基本的观点，它所创造的最基本的对立，就是它认为自己是分离的</font>。这一假设如此根本，以至于心灵甚至无法将其视为一种假设。这就像水对鱼一样。心灵将其视为存在的一个既定事实。它不会质疑这一范式，因为这一范式如此深入，以至于它甚至无法被看作是一个范式。或许在理智上可以，但在血肉之躯的层面，不行。

而这一范式影响了生活的方方面面。自然地，<font color=red>由于心灵感觉到了分离，它就必须挣扎、奋斗、生存，让事情变得“正确”</font>。

事实上，正确与错误的问题是心灵最引人入胜的方面之一。心灵认为许多事情是错误的，因为它认为许多事情直接或间接地威胁到它作为一个独立存在的生存。

如果有人偷了我们的电脑，这是“错误的”，因为心灵认为这对生存构成了威胁。如果有人或某事与我们头脑中的模型不同，我们就称他们或它是“错误的”。

所有的心灵都有病，但**一个简单的测试，用来衡量心灵的病态程度，就是观察它有多少“抱怨”**。




## 第五章
一天晚上，大师七里居尊正在冥想，一个小偷拿着剑闯进来，要求他交出钱财或者生命。大师说：“不要打扰我。钱就在那边的抽屉里。”小偷收集了钱财，准备离开。大师说：“记得要感谢我。”小偷感谢了他，然后离开了。

小偷因其他罪行被捕，也坦白了对大师的盗窃行为。大师被传唤作证，当被问及发生了什么时，七里说：“一个人来了，我送了他一笔钱。他感谢了我，然后离开了。那里没有小偷。”

<font color=red>我们每个人通过我们所注意到的东西来创造自己的现实</font>，通过我们附加在事物之上的概念和解释。<font color=red>现实本身是无法被心灵所知晓的</font>。我们的感官确实是微小的窗口。例如，我们的视觉能力只是整个电磁光谱中微小的一部分。

关于可用的数据，我们的感官会过滤掉其中的大部分。例如，研究表明，青蛙的眼睛只注意到昆虫特有的附近运动。其他所有的视觉数据都被过滤掉了。

而大脑接收到的那一点数据**还必须由大脑进行解释，然后我们才会体验到视觉或其他任何感官的感觉**。没有办法确定大脑是否完全在内部制造了它的产物——而我们所认为的感官数据可能只是大脑内部计算的一部分。

换句话说，<font color=red>我们并不真正知道外面有什么</font>，我们实际上对我们之外存在的东西一无所知。而且<font color=red>外面可能什么都没有；我们所有的感官数据可能完全是大脑内部的产物</font>。没有办法确定这一点。

然而，我们所有的概念、信念、观点、知识最终都基于感官数据。**现实的本质是无法被心灵所知晓的**。一个人坐在房间里，同房间里一只蚂蚁在地板上爬行。它感知到的现实与那个人完全不同。哪个现实是正确的？两者都是。两者都不是。两者都没有感知到终极现实。两者都有自己的版本。

道家大师**庄子**说：“你怎么能跟井底之蛙谈论大海呢？”心灵总是困在自己的小井里，被其有限的数据所限制，然后又通过它对数据形成的概念和信念进一步限制自己。然后，这些概念、信念、态度、模型等构成了进一步感知和解释数据的屏幕。<font color=red>心灵生活在自己的井里，却认为自己的井就是全部</font>。它认为自己的井就是事物的真实状态，它认为自己的井就是大海本身。

另一种看待这个问题的方式是，将心灵视为一个投影仪，它只是把现实当作一个屏幕，用来投射它自己对事物的版本。心灵将它的幻想、态度、概念和模型投射到现实中，然后将这个电影与现实本身混淆。

心灵是一个梦想家，它甚至一刻也不停止做梦。它将自己的梦境与现实混淆，就像我们在睡眠中所做的梦在我们做梦的时候对我们来说是真实的。<font color=red>我们对现实的版本只是另一种类型的梦。我们创造了它，我们制造了它。我们对周围世界的体验完全是我们自己的创造；我们对它负有全部责任</font>。

因此，当我们看到“错误”的时候，我们觉得外面的某样东西必须被改变。我们怎么可能通过外部手段改变一个幻觉，当它完全是一个内部的事情呢？当我们纠正了一个“错误”，更多会冒出来，但这种事物是错误的感觉可以永远持续下去。

屏幕上的图像可能在变化，但这不是问题；问题是投影仪是否仍然开着。<font color=red>除非我们深入探究心灵本身的本质，否则我们会不断地改变梦境——但我们仍然在做梦</font>。

另一种表达心灵对现实的虚幻版本的方式是说，<font color=red>心灵总是处于药物的影响之下，它总是在自我麻醉</font>。心灵是一个吸毒者。而它的毒品是什么？它的毒品是权力、财富、地位、知识、声望。它的毒品是食物、性、冒险、酒精和药片。它的毒品是成就、目标、拯救世界、迷恋、成为群体的一部分、创造力。它的毒品是各种信念和故事。它的毒品是仇恨、愤怒、嫉妒、快乐、忧郁等等。

心灵总是处于药物的影响之下，它永远无法看到真实。心灵想要兴奋起来，这样它就不必经历它的痛苦。但兴奋的本质是我们必须下来。而当心灵下来时，它会立即寻找另一种毒品，以便再次兴奋起来。它想要一个新的男人或女人，一份新的工作，一个新的城市，一件新的衣服，一部新的电影。这个过程不断持续，**心灵从未意识到它的毒品并不是解决问题的办法**。

心灵永远无法意识到这一点，因为<font color=red>心灵生活在希望之中</font>。明天会更好。但明天永远不会来，也永远无法来，因为当它到来时，它总是今天。未来无法到来。这里永远只有当下这一刻。<font color=red>如果我们仔细观察，我们会发现正是这种希望、这种欲望本身创造了时间</font>。

想象一下，安静地坐着，没有任何欲望，幸福而平静。没有时间。我们只是处于永恒的此刻。现在让一个欲望进入我们的存在，我们又回到了时间之中。如果满足我们的欲望需要一个月，那么我们就创造了一个月的时间。如果需要一个小时，那么我们就创造了一个小时的时间。

我们不仅有一个，而是有成千上万大大小小的欲望。因此，时间永远都不够。我们觉得时间从我们身边溜走，生活正在错过我们。这就是我们害怕死亡的原因，因为我们需要更多的时间。我们还没有实现我们的欲望，我们还没有完成我们想要做的事情。我们需要更多的时间，但时间却不够。是我们的欲望创造了这一切。如果我们没有欲望，我们也不会害怕死亡；我们会准备好面对它。

<font color=red>心灵因为欲望而处于地狱之中</font>。我们注意到了吗？当我们痛苦的时候，时间过得很慢，似乎拖拖拉拉。在内心深处，心灵总是痛苦的，因为它把时间花在了当下之外。这就是地狱的样子。它看起来像我们处于当下之外时的生活。

相反，如果我们没有欲望，没有目标，我们会完全幸福，时间会加速，直到没有时间——直到只剩下这一刻。那将是天堂，是天堂。但对于心灵来说，这是不可能的，因为心灵充满了欲望。欲望是它本质的一部分。




## 第六章
当心灵终于看到自身的痛苦时，它便踏上了精神的探索之旅。此时，它不再渴望金钱、权力、财富和享乐，而是渴望上帝、天堂、觉悟和转变。然而，深入观察我们会发现，一切并未改变。**目标虽有不同，但本质相同；心灵仍在追寻**。

而正是这种追寻构成了心灵的存在。<font color=red>心灵是运动的，心灵是忙碌的</font>。在精神探索的过程中，心灵通常会陷入形而上学的教义之中，并紧紧抓住它们，为它们争论不休，仿佛在做着什么重要的事情。

有一个真实的故事。一位禅学学生问：“师父，我们死后会存活吗？我们会轮回吗？如果是这样，我们会保留记忆还是会失去记忆？我们会失去个性的所有方面还是会保留某些方面？我们多久才会轮回？‘或者整个轮回观念是错误的，西方关于不朽灵魂的观念更准确？如果是这样，我们在天堂和地狱中是否会保留记忆还是会失去记忆？在人间和天堂之间还有其他领域吗？’”

“你的早餐要凉了。”师父回答道。

<font color=red>心灵能够理解复杂的事物，却难以理解简单的事物</font>。生活是简单的……一场日落，一场暴雨，一朵花。生活如此简单，以至于超出了我们的理解。心灵无法理解它，<font color=red><b>无法理解毫无目的或目标地活在当下</b></font>。因此，心灵总是试图将生活装进一个框子里，去构建它，从它所看到的混乱中创造出秩序。当面对无限和未知时，心灵会感到极度焦虑，因此它紧紧抓住它的框子和结构，拼命地试图变得确定。

它提出问题。为什么会有痛苦？为什么会有疾病？为什么会有仇恨？为什么会有痛苦？为什么会有死亡？<font color=red>心灵渴望得到答案</font>。

它没有意识到，提问和寻找答案的冲动本身就源于一种不满的情绪。当我们快乐时，我们不会问为什么爱会存在。当我们健康时，我们不会问为什么健康会存在。只有当存在痛苦和不满时，问题才会产生。

心灵总是处于痛苦之中，因为它总是在试图去到别的地方；因此它寻找答案。如果它处于极乐之中，如果它只是活在当下，所有的问题都会从它身上消失。它将不再有任何需求。但心灵无法放下它的执着，因为执着就是它的本质。心灵是有病的；只有当存在疾病时，才会去寻找药物。

心灵想要对存在强加秩序，因为存在太过狂野、太过混乱。正如奥修所说，就在我们刚刚适应我们的智慧和生活方式……我们就死了。然后一个新的婴儿来到这个世界，一无所知，甚至不知道自己是谁。

这是一个混乱！大树死去，小种子发芽。星系死去，新的星系诞生。一个混乱！如果心灵得偿所愿，就不会有死亡，但那时也不会有生命。一切都将是完美的、机械的、高效的、有序的——并且是死气沉沉的。因为新的事物将变得不可能。

混乱使新的事物成为可能；这就是它的意义所在。<font color=red>心灵将自己束缚在规则、教条、态度、“应该”之中</font>，然后又奇怪为什么生活的味道消失了，为什么生活似乎越来越像是走马观花。心灵成了自己框子的囚徒。

<font color=red>心灵是一个完美主义者</font>，试图找到那些刚刚好的结构和答案。它是一个理想主义者，试图实现某个诱人目标——政治的、道德的、法律的、文化的、科学的、艺术的、经济的、宗教的，无论什么。而只有不可能的事情才看起来真正吸引人，因为**只有不可能的事情看起来才是完美的**。

心灵一次又一次地达不到它的理想……再次尝试，再次失败，再次变得痛苦……游戏继续。这是一种自我陶醉的行为，必须实现不可能的事情。

只有可能的和不完美的才是人性。心灵总是渴望超人的，而超人的总是非人的。<font color=red><b>对心灵来说，最难的事情就是保持平凡、自然，不特别</b></font>。

相反，自我/心灵非常努力地想要变得独特、特别、非凡。它想要脱颖而出，引人注目。<font color=red>事实上，这种想要变得非凡的渴望是绝对平凡的，因为它无处不在，这就是心灵的日常本质</font>。

而且，<font color=red>心灵是一个极端主义者</font>，为了变得独特和特别，它会在一个极端和另一个极端之间摇摆。<font color=red>它永远无法简单地保持平衡，因为那样它就会停止存在</font>。心灵本身就是一种失衡，它会不惜一切代价变得特别。如果它在追求享乐中感到失败，它就会开始追求痛苦。如果它认为通过贬低自己可以变得优越，它就会去做。如果它在生活中没有成功，它就会寻求自杀，寻求死亡。

最重要的是，<font color=red>心灵是一个行动者</font>。必须做点什么——关于自己的生活，关于这个世界，关于别人，关于这种情况和那种情况。心灵天生具有暴力倾向，它总是愿意在必要时使用武力。为了实现它的完美理想，可能必须使用强制手段。<font color=red>对心灵来说，目的可以证明手段的正当性</font>。

它想要掰开花蕾以获得玫瑰，然后却惊讶于花瓣落在地上，而它手中什么也没有。



## 第七章
所以这就是心灵：它感到孤立和孤独，并且有一种生存的需要。它看到到处都是错误，并且想要改变事物，包括它自身的一部分，以便让它们变得“正确”。它是行动、运动、挣扎、奋斗——<font color=red>总是试图到达某个地方，但却从未活在当下</font>。它是以自我为中心的，自私的，<font color=red>总是在一切事物中盘算自己的收益</font>——即使是在利他主义中也是如此。

那么，它所追求的收益是什么呢？是它自身的观点、看法、意见、信念、辩解、行为、故事和表现的延续。收益在于它能够证明自己是对的。最终，心灵是一个自我欺骗者。它遭受痛苦，却说服自己是相对快乐的。它活在过去和未来，却说服自己活在当下。它一无所知，却说服自己掌握了真理。

现在，让我们深入探究。首先要注意的是，<font color=red>心灵是一个群体</font>……在某一刻感到满足，而在另一刻感到悲伤；在某一刻感到嫉妒，而在另一刻感到挫败；在某一刻感到满足，而在另一刻感到无聊。没有统一性。在不同的时刻，不同的“演员”占据中心舞台。而且思绪如此之多……在各个方向上拉扯，在这个话题和那个话题之间徘徊，不断变化。

如果我们把情绪和感觉仅仅视为不同类型的思绪，那么我们会注意到，思绪如同一场永无止境的游行，每一个都与前一个不同。这是一个混合体，一个群体……一个“人群”。

一个群体最有趣的特征是，**根本不存在所谓的“群体”**。我们能找到一个群体，而忽略了站在那里的个体吗？不能。群体只是一个抽象的概念。只有个体存在，但当所有个体站在一起时，就会给人一种除了个体之外还存在某种东西的错觉。然而，只有个体是真实存在的。

**心灵就是这样。<font color=red>如果我们仔细观察，我们会发现根本不存在所谓的“心灵”</font>。只有一个个独立的思绪**。一个思绪接着另一个思绪，无休止地延续，给人一种除了思绪本身之外还存在某种东西的错觉，但其实并没有。**如果我们去寻找我们的心灵，我们永远也找不到它**。我们只会找到一个个独立的思绪。**心灵是一个抽象的概念，它并不存在**。

那么，这种“我”的感觉，这种独立存在的感觉，又是什么呢？它本身是一系列的思绪，正如佛陀首先指出的那样。事实上，我们总是不断地思考自己。一家电话公司曾做过一项研究，发现人们使用频率最高的词是“我”。**这个“我”实际上是一种假设，是基于一系列思绪而形成的结论。它本身就是一个思绪**。

如果我们观察我们的思绪，我们会发现它们就像玻璃或椅子一样，是具体的事物。<font color=red size=4><b>每个思绪都像海浪从海洋中升起</b></font>。它凭空出现，短暂存在，然后又消失回它来的地方。

每个思绪都自行升起又自行消散，**它不受任何控制**。问问自己：你能改变昨天的思绪吗？不能。你能改变明天的思绪吗？不能。你能改变你此刻正在想的思绪吗？不能。因为“此刻”已经过去了。你会惊讶地发现，你无法改变任何思绪。“你”对它们没有任何控制权。它们自行出现又自行消失。它们是独立存在的事物。

这就是心灵的困境。它想要控制一切，并且幻想自己是自己决策的掌控者。它认为自己是选择者、决策者、自我引导者。但实际上，它并没有选择，也没有决策，也没有引导任何事物，因为它并不存在。它所有的选择和决策都只是更多自行出现的思绪。

讽刺的是，心灵花费大量时间挣扎着去控制事物，**实际上却什么也控制不了，因为它并不存在**。没有自我引导者，没有选择者，没有决策者。并不是说思绪不存在；它们是存在的。但并没有一个中心在引导它们。根本就没有中心，那只是一个幻觉。心灵认为自己是掌控者、选择者，而恰恰是这个东西并不存在。心灵本身并不存在。

心灵害怕失去控制。它害怕失控，因为它认为自己是掌控者。失控等同于不存在。**在最深层面上，心灵无法放手，因为那意味着放手自己的存在**。

矛盾的是，心灵本来就不存在，它只是认为自己存在。它本来就没有任何选择，它只是认为自己在选择。存在的只是一个个孤立的思绪，一个接一个，其中一些是关于存在一个自我引导的实体，这个实体做出决策，它知道真理，它是相对快乐的，如此等等。

于是，我们看到了这样一幅景象：一个实际上并不存在的东西，却花费时间试图生存下去。

这并不是一个学术问题。因为心灵是什么？是我们。我们的所有思绪、情感、态度、观点、行为、故事、表现和行为模式都是心灵。**<u>我们是心灵，心灵就是我们</u>**。

**如果我们幻想自己有某个部分是独立于心灵之外的，那就再仔细看看吧。我们没有任何部分不是心灵。我们所认为的自己的任何东西，都仅仅是心灵而已**。



## 第八章

所以，说“心灵”不存在，意味着“你”和“我”也不存在。我们以为自己在做决策，但实际上并没有人在做这些决策。“你”和“我”作为自我引导者、掌控者、选择者，是不存在的。那里没有人。存在的只是思绪……**以及通过一种伺服机制在活动中表达自己的思绪**。我们所认为的“我们”的每一个事物，都只是另一个思绪而已。没有中心。“你”和“我”是一种幻觉。

<font color=red>事实上，我们完全是一种刺激/反应机制。一台机器</font>。一台非常复杂的机器，但仍然是机器。通常，我们习惯于只把诸如点唱机和台球这样的物体视为完全处于刺激-反应范畴内。我们在点唱机上按下按钮，它就会播放《白色圣诞》。我们击打一个台球，它就会在球桌上滚动。

但现在让我们上升到植物生命的层面。植物是一种被设定为以特定方式对环境做出反应的机制。光照在它上面，它的化学反应就会将碳和矿物质转化为糖和氧气。

再来看看动物。行为主义者证明，动物的行为完全在刺激-反应的范围内。我们可能喜欢或不喜欢这种观点，同意或不同意，但这一事实仍然存在。看起来猫似乎在选择是否走进卧室，但实际上它只是在对刺激做出反应。

**在这方面，植物和动物的区别在于，动物有一套更复杂的反应机制，它能够区分不同类型的刺激**。例如，宠物通常能够区分它认识的人和它不认识的人，并且能够以多种不同的方式做出相应的反应。**动物的刺激-反应比植物丰富得多，但本质是相同的**。

现在让我们上升到人类层面。人类也是一种刺激-反应机制，但要复杂得多。人类机制能够区分成千上万种不同类型的刺激，其反应范围极为广泛和丰富。

但也许这并不是人类和动物机制之间最重要的区别。也许最重要的区别是，<font color=red>我们人类有一个“旁白”</font>——一种伴随的声音，它将我们所有的反应进行解释、辩解和合理化。这个**心理旁白**是刺激-反应系统的组成部分，但它引发了“我”的概念，从而产生了这个“我”在引导自己、在选择和决策的想法。

如果一个台球从悬崖上被扔下去，它会下落。如果一个动物从悬崖上被扔下去，它会下落，而它的生物体在下落过程中会产生恐惧的情绪。如果你或我被从悬崖上扔下去，我们会下落，我们的反应会包括一系列情绪，如恐惧、愤怒、后悔等。然而，除此之外，还会有一些别的东西——会有一个旁白一直伴随着我们，讲述我们为什么被扔下去、正在发生什么、将会发生什么等等。所有这些都属于反应机制的一部分。

使我们很难将人类视为完全的刺激-反应机制的原因之一是，这种机制的反应范围包括能够改变其对未来刺激的反应能力。<font color=red>我们人类的一种反应是改变我们未来的反应。这种非常复杂的反应看起来像是“选择”，尽管它仍然是刺激-反应</font>。

另一个障眼法是，人类机制的反应往往是不可预测的——仅仅是因为我们太复杂了。人类机制复杂得令人难以置信，以至于我们常常无法预测反应会是什么，而这种不可预测性被进一步当作选择和控制的证据。

**一方面说心灵完全是一个刺激-反应机制，另一方面又说心灵创造了它自己对现实的版本，这似乎是一个悖论。但仔细观察，我们会发现这两个说法实际上是在说同一件事**。

心灵对环境中的刺激做出反应，**而它的一部分反应是标记、分类、评判和评价**。基于这些，它渴望某些事物，而希望避免另一些事物。然后，它会根据环境是否提供它所渴望的东西而感受到快乐或痛苦。但它渴望什么，以及它对得到的东西的反应，完全取决于它自身的编程。因此，**它在某一时刻感受到的快乐或痛苦，取决于它自身的刺激-反应条件反射，而不是环境所提供的东西**。

换句话说，<font color=red>**心灵通过创造它自己对现实的版本来对现实做出反应**</font>。那匹马真的不好。樱桃真的比哈密瓜好吃。我做那件事真的有理由。等等。这些说法中的每一个都是对现实的一种版本，每一个都是完全由心灵创造的。

心灵完全是一个刺激-反应机制，同时它也完全负责它对现实的体验。而且，不仅心灵是刺激-反应的，环境也是如此；一切都是刺激-反应。心灵试图掌控一切，但根本不存在所谓的独立控制。**环境的所有部分，包括心灵作为其中的一部分，都在做出反应**。早在行为主义者出现之前，佛陀就称这种现象为“缘起共生”。




## 第九章
另一种看待方式是将心灵视为一台极其复杂的计算机。计算机的组成部分有哪些呢？计算机有输入端，数据通过这些端口进入并被处理。它有输出端，经过处理的数据从这里输出到外部环境。它有一个中央处理单元（CPU），数据在这里被处理。还有存储单元，用于存放数据和程序。

那么什么是程序呢？程序只不过是一系列供CPU执行的指令……先做这个，然后做那个，接着再做这个……如此这般。**每条指令都很简单，但由于计算机能够在每秒内执行数百万条这样的指令，最终结果看起来和实际都非常复杂。**

在计算机的众多程序中，有一个主程序——它是一系列指令，规定了哪些程序将被执行、以何种顺序以及在何种情况下执行。值得注意的是，主程序也只是一个普通的程序。它没有任何自我决定或自我引导的特性。它根据情境——刺激——按照指令做出反应。结果可能非常精细，但纯粹是刺激-反应机制。

现在将心灵与这台计算机进行比较。心灵的输入是五种感官。它的输出是思想、情感、面部表情、姿势、行为等……我们内在和外在的全部表现。 <font color=red>我们可以用“磁带”这个词来称呼所有的输出。刺激进入，心灵对其进行处理，并产生一个反应，即磁带。</font> 这个磁带可能是愤怒，可能是微笑，可能是关于天气的思考，也可能是去上班。心灵所做的一切，无论是心理的还是身体的，都是磁带。

心灵当然有存储库，用于存放各种类型的数据和程序。而且 <font color=red>心灵有一个执行子程序，它根据其中的指令决定在任何给定时刻运行哪个程序，从而决定展示哪一盘磁带</font>。

<font color=red>这个主程序只关乎一件事，那就是生存。每一刻，执行子程序都会将舞台中心交给那个根据其指令最能确保生存的子程序。</font>生存可能表现为躺在海滩上晒太阳，可能表现为完成作业，也可能表现为嫉妒。**磁带将是在那一刻看起来最能优化生存的内容，综合考虑所有因素。**

**生存的表现形式可能非常奇特。假设有人打了我们一个耳光。**心灵会在其存储库中搜索一个类似的情境。假设它找到了一个早期的情节，当时有人打了我们，我们晕倒了——但我们活了下来。它从存储中调出那个程序并运行它。

现在，在当下，被耳光打过后，我们晕倒了。对这颗心灵来说，这看起来是最像生存的方式。对于另一个有着不同经历的心灵来说，在那种情况下，生存可能表现为愤怒、讨好、哭泣或其他什么形式。但对于**这颗心灵在这种情况**下，生存看起来最像晕倒。所以它就这么做了。

但心灵不止于此。它不仅会在这种特定情况下通过晕倒来应对，还会倾向于反复设置让我们能够晕倒并失去意识的情境。毕竟，我们晕倒时是存活下来的，不是吗？因此，这颗心灵会试图创造让我们能够晕倒的环境。

如果我们观察自己，会发现自己在生活中反复制造某些模式。总是遇到不负责任员工的老板；总是因为不可抗力迟到的人；总是喜欢新工作，直到逐渐发现同事对他不公平的人。可能的模式是无穷无尽的。

心灵通过反复设置这些情境获得回报；**它得以生存，得以证明自己的观点是正确的**。员工确实不负责任。情况确实迫使我迟到。我的同事确实不公平。对心灵来说，这就是生存。而这一切都是刺激-反应，都是自动化的机械运作。

将心灵视为计算机（在其目前的初级形态）传达了心灵的机械性和自动性，但这种比喻并未完全体现其本质。**因为心灵远比当今任何计算机都要精细**。例如，正如前面所说，<font color=red>心灵的程序中有一部分能力是可以改变对未来刺激的反应</font>。

这种特性并非心灵独有，但在当今地球上，心灵在这一方面达到了独特的程度。这是一种非常复杂的刺激-反应形式。当这些程序的改变是有意识的时，它们被标记为“改进”，并被心灵视为其自主选择和独立本质的证据。

这正是这台计算机，即心灵的一个非常有趣的特征。它的部分程序是一个观念，即它是自我引导的，是一个“我”，是一个独立的实体，能够控制自己并在多种选择中做出决定。而这都是幻觉。**并没有控制，也没有选择在发生。没有中心，没有“我”。只有刺激-反应，自动化的程序。**

如果我们拆解这台计算机式的心灵，我们永远不会找到这个“我”，永远不会找到这种自我选择的本质，因为它并不存在。这在原则上与拆解一辆汽车并无不同。如果我们把汽车的所有部件都拆掉，就什么都不会剩下；除了部件之外，没有“汽车”的本质。同样，如果我们把心灵的所有自动化程序都拿走，就不会剩下任何心灵，也不会剩下任何“我”。因为“我”从未真正存在过。




## 第十章
然而，正是因为这种 **“自我”** 的感觉，<font color=red>各种奇怪的现象才会发生</font>。<font color=red>既然存在“自我”，就必须设法让这个“自我”存活下来</font>。这个实际上并不存在的独立的“自我”，试图找到维持其存在的方式。这个实际上什么也控制不了的控制者，试图找到维持和增强其控制的方法。**难怪心灵如此忙碌；它面临着一个无法解决的问题！**

<font color=red>实际上，唯一的问题就是“自我”本身</font>，但心灵却看不到这一点。<font color=red>心灵本身才是唯一的问题</font>，这就是为什么心灵无法解决它的问题。

于是，整个游戏就此展开。心灵在其挣扎和奋斗中，在其活动和努力中，试图解决一个无法解决的问题。它忙于生存和安全的问题，从过去作出反应，向未来伸手，<font color=red>它永远无法活在当下。它永远无法放手，永远无法完全活在当下，因为一旦如此，它就不存在了</font>。

心灵从环境中收集权力、金钱、地位、盟友、爱人、财产、答案和认同，徒劳地试图解决它的问题。它将自己的故事投射到现实中，以至于它看不到现实，然后思考现实应该如何被改变。心灵试图改进、改变、变得更好、变得不同，但从根本上说，游戏仍然是相同的。

只要深入洞察这个幻象，就会发现心灵就是活动，心灵就是思想。心灵是解决问题、播放磁带、朝着目标奋斗。它全都是运动。<font color=red>心灵是忙碌，忙碌就是心灵</font>。既然心灵本身是生活中唯一的问题，这意味着<font color=red>心灵的运动才是实际的问题</font>。

进一步说，既然运动就是心灵，<font color=red>任何运动或行动实际上都在加剧问题，而不是解决问题</font>。的确，正是这种运动或行动本身才是**问题所在**。

如果我们仔细观察，就会发现，最终我们所有试图改进、改变、变得不同或更好的尝试，都是问题的一部分。是谁在试图变得更好？是心灵。试图变得更好或不同，仅仅是维持心灵运动的一种方式，从而维持了心灵本身。

在试图改变或变得不同的过程中，是谁在尝试？是心灵。这种努力本身才是问题，才是心灵。它延续了生活中唯一的痛苦，那就是<font color=red>希望事物与此时此刻的实际情况不同</font>。

也就是说，<font color=red>我们生活中认为是解决问题的方法，其实正是问题本身</font>。我们为获得幸福所做的一切努力，正是让我们深陷痛苦的原因。我们为改善事物所做的一切，正是让事物保持现状的原因。

看看吧。你会看到，心灵的运动——它的欲望、分别、努力、挣扎——才是唯一的问题。除此之外，没有其他问题。

心灵创造了它自己版本的现实，并将其当作现实本身。发现这个“现实”不足之后，它又试图去改变事物，却没有意识到问题不是现实本身，而是它自己创造的版本。<font color=red>现实本身从来不是问题；只有我们关于现实的故事才是问题</font>。

心灵把问题强加于现实中，只是为了给自己找些事情做，因为正是这种“做事”的行为维持了心灵的存在。除了这种心灵的渴望之外，没有其他问题。

如果心灵是问题，那么为什么不采取措施来消除、改变或熄灭心灵呢？只要看到，这个问题本身也是来自心灵。在试图熄灭心灵时，是谁在尝试？是心灵。在试图改变心灵时，是谁在努力？是心灵。

<font color=red>这就是心灵目前正在做的事情。它试图改进、改变，让事情变得不同、变得更好</font>。所有这些可能暂时缓解问题，让我们分心，或者更好地适应它，但它无法消除或解决它。它怎么可能呢？所有这些正是问题所在。

正如拜伦·凯蒂所说，我们希望事物与实际情况不同的欲望，正是我们生活中的痛苦。所有的欲望都是对当下不存在的东西的渴望。欲望本身就是痛苦，因为它阻止我们体验当下的完美和富足。

因此，我们对生活中获得满足的渴望，正是让生活无法满足的原因。我们希望改变世界，让它更符合我们的接受标准，正是这种渴望让它在我们眼中的现实里变得无法接受。我们希望让事情变得完美，正是这种渴望让它们保持不完美。

有可能深刻地看到，什么都做不了。<font color=red>我们无法通过任何行动来解决或逃离这种状况</font>，因为任何行动都只是维持现状的另一种方式。

我们无法摆脱心灵，因为“我们”就是心灵，我们所认为的“自我”没有任何部分是独立于心灵之外的。认为“你”作为一个独立的实体存在，正是生活的问题所在；那么“你”又如何能解决这个问题呢？




## 第十一章
那么，你可能会问，为什么不干脆放手呢？为什么不接受一切的现状呢？观察一下。这不过是心灵用以维持自身存在的一种方式罢了。是谁决定要放手呢？是谁决定要接受一切呢？是心灵。控制者怎么可能不试图去控制呢？成就者怎么可能不试图去达成目标呢？改进者怎么可能不试图去改进呢？这就好比要求鼻子不要成为鼻子一样。

<font color=red>心灵根本无法真正放手或接受现状</font>，因为这种尝试本身就会延续心灵的存在，延续那个“不接受者”的存在。当然，我们可以假装接受，可以让自己相信我们接受了一切，但这不过是一种头脑的游戏罢了。在内心深处，“我”的坚固性其实被进一步强化了。

那么，其他的解决办法呢？去爱每一个人。为他人服务。去寻求上帝或觉悟。或者干脆什么都不在乎。但仔细看看。<font color=red>决定去爱每一个人，也不过是另一种心灵的“磁带”</font>。是谁决定要去爱呢？是心灵。而**决定去爱或试图去爱是一种误导的努力，因为真正的爱与试图变得有爱毫无关系**。

爱是自然而然发生的；它是无需努力且不自主的。爱是一种坠落；它自行发生，无法强求。

试图去爱是心灵的行为。它是虚假的，与真正的爱相去甚远。

好吧，那么也许我们会决定忘记自己，去为他人服务。但我们连自己都无法服务好，又怎么能真正为他人服务呢？<font color=red>如果自己池塘里的水还是浑浊的，我们又怎么能指望去澄清别人的池塘呢</font>？在我们看来是好事的行为，可能会带来糟糕的结果。认为自己在做好事，这是心灵的想法；它强化了构成心灵的幻象。

并不是说为他人服务是不好的。但当它真正发生时，它就像爱一样——是不自主的、无需努力的。而且没有任何关于自己在为他人服务的想法，没有任何决定。它就是发生了。

也许，我们会去寻求上帝或觉悟。但谁会去寻求呢？是的，是心灵。去寻求上帝、觉悟或任何一种转变，不过是心灵维持自身存在、延续其运动的另一种方式罢了。

<font color=red>追求金钱、权力、享乐和追求神圣看起来可能截然不同，但它们的本质是一样的。这仍然是追求。这仍然是试图到达我们所在之处之外的某个地方。这仍然是心灵试图超越心灵。追求本身是心灵。解决方案就是障碍</font>。

一个笑话：我们怎样才能找到上帝？她正等着我们回家，而我们却找不到她，因为我们还在外面寻找她。

还有最终的解决办法——干脆什么都不在乎，完全不做任何事情。但这并不会改变什么，因为深层的痛苦依然存在。而谁在选择不在乎呢？是的，是心灵。选择不在乎，是在延续选择者，是在延续这个虚幻的“我”。这不过是同样的游戏，问题依然存在。<font color=red>假装它不存在，不过是问题延续自身的一种方式罢了</font>。

心灵是问题所在，但仔细观察我们会发现，我们无法从它那里逃脱。因为所有的逃避尝试都是心灵的行为，都是问题本身。甚至决定不去逃避也是一种逃避的尝试，因为这样的决定延续了决策者的幻象。所有的尝试到达那里的方式，都是无法到达那里的方式。**所有的出路最终都回到原点**。这就像是把一面镜子对着另一面镜子——一个无限的回归，无边无际，永无止境。

任何事物都是心灵用以延续自身的素材。没有任何一种活动不能服务于心灵的目的，因为活动本身就是心灵。所有选择、挣扎、追求目标和控制的努力都是心灵的行为。反之，所有不选择、不挣扎、不追求目标和不控制的努力也是心灵的行为。这一切都是心灵。

所有的思想、情感、态度、观点、感觉、立场、行为、故事、表现、回应——所有这些，一切都在维持心灵，就是心灵。没有任何东西被排除在外。关于我们的一切，都是问题的一部分。<font color=red>“我们”自己就是问题</font>。

**如果“你”和“我”就是我们生活中的问题，那么这个问题如何解决呢？它无法解决。我们又如何能摆脱这个虚构的“你”和“我”呢？我们做不到；这就是“我们”是谁。**那么我们又如何能改善我们的处境呢？我们也做不到。当然，我们可以欺骗自己，但在最深层面上，没有任何办法可以改善它。

只要看到我们所有的解决方案都是问题本身，所有的逃避都是囚禁，所有的变好都是疾病。进一步看到，我们必须试图去解决它、逃避它、改善它，因为这是心灵的本质，这就是它所做的，这就是“我们”是谁。它是完全无法解决的。我们所有的解决方案和非解决方案都是障碍。

问题：如果这一切都是如此，那么应该做些什么呢？

答案：<font color=red>什么也不做</font>，因为什么都做不了。

问题：如果什么都做不了，那么我们接下来该去哪里呢？

答案：<font color=red>哪里也不去</font>。

问题：但如果这样的话，这一切的意义又是什么呢？

答案：<font color=red>没有任何意义</font>。

心灵认为一切都必须有一个意义，否则意义何在呢？这本身也是问题的一部分。心灵认为这些话语必须有一个意义，但事实上它们没有任何意义。这些话语只是概念、结构、框架——毫无重要性。

<font color=red>因此，这一切没有任何“真实”的东西。这里使用的任何概念在任何意义上都不是真实的。或许暂时有用，但并非真实。如果心灵执着于它们，那不过是心灵延续自身、延续那个分离的“你”和“我”的另一种方式罢了</font>。

事实上，逻辑学家会指出，这些概念中包含了诸多矛盾。但这并不重要。还会出现更多矛盾；这不可避免。而且，它们还挺有趣的。

所有这些话语——过去、未来，还有这句话本身——**不过是用来创造一个超越概念的某种情境的工具罢了**。这可能不会立刻发生，可能需要数月甚至数年，但这并不重要，因为无论如何它都无法被加速或强迫。而且也无法被延缓。

说真的——你觉得这个笑话有趣吗？——说真的，这些话语不过是在沙盒里玩耍，是在潮湿的沙子里来回传递玩具，是在湿沙中建造沙堡。它们根本没有任何意义。看到这一点吧。



## 第十二章
<font color=red><font color=red>我们人类所面临的中心困境，我们生活的核心问题，无法在问题被提出所在的层面上得到解决。这是一个非凡的问题，因为所有试图解决它的方式都构成了问题本身。每一次试图改变它、改善它、压制它、解决它的努力——只会使问题更加严重</font>。这就像一个陷入流沙的人，他试图摆脱困境的每一个努力只会让他越陷越深。

问题是，问题是什么？问题是，大脑是一个解决问题的机制，却被自身生存的问题所困扰。似乎这个问题是大脑继承而来的。似乎大脑发现自己独自处于一个冷漠的世界中，这个世界在最坏的情况下显得公然敌对，而在最好的情况下也显得漠不关心。但事实并非如此。**大脑创造了它自己的问题——然后又耗费精力试图解决它自己制造的问题。**

当然，既然问题是一种幻觉，它就无法被解决。大脑作为控制者、选择者、命运的引导者是不存在的——只有刺激与反应存在。如果<font color=red>作为控制者的大脑不存在</font>，它又如何能够生存呢？通过伪装；通过看不到它不存在的事实。

大脑是一场魔术表演，是一场利用镜子的把戏，它是一个让不存在的东西看起来存在下来的魔术师。你看到盒子里的女士被锯成两半，但她并没有被锯成两半；有些东西是虚构的。这就是大脑。不存在的大脑魔术师通过解决自身生存问题的手段来生存。

如果我们仔细审视我们的生活，我们会发现它与生存有关。<font color=red>大脑通过问题本身来生存</font>；解决问题的努力就是大脑本身。如果大脑的奋斗消失，大脑本身也会消失。

大脑愿意花费一生的时间来维持这个骗局——试图安排事情，让不存在的东西能够生存。它愿意用一生的时间来忍受这种荒谬的挣扎所带来的痛苦。

而且，它不仅愿意这样做，而且必须这样做；这是它的本性。大脑——你和我——会一直上演这场喜剧悲剧，直到我们踏入坟墓的那一刻。大脑别无选择；它必须这样做。它除了做魔术师之外，什么也做不了——而它是最伟大的魔术师，因为它的把戏是让魔术师自己看起来存在，但实际上并不存在。

因此，问题根本无法解决，因为所有试图解决它的努力都构成了问题本身。<font color=red>问题只能被超越，但这种超越并不是任何形式的行动。什么也没有做。</font>没有任何改善或改变，因为在最深层次上，没有任何改善或改变是可能的。相反，一种觉察、一种洞察出现了，然后问题就不再被视为问题了。



# 存在
既然问题不再被体验为问题，那么可以说问题已经消失了。一切都没有改变，情况依然如故，但问题却消失了。

事实上，现在并没有，而且<font color=red>生活中从未有过任何问题——除了魔术表演，大脑对正在发生的事情的解释和故事</font>。

真正看到这一点，就意味着超越了大脑的问题。而当这种情况发生时，**生活中的问题就像孩子长大后最喜欢的玩具一样——它被简单地遗忘了**。玩具仍然在衣橱里，它本身并没有任何变化。但现在它不再重要了。它已经被超越了。

当然，这种超越并不是任何形式的行动。它不是大脑做的事情，也不是“你”和“我”做的事情。**超越根本不是由大脑完成的**。相反，是大脑本身被超越了。“你”和“我”被超越了。

但这是如何做到的呢？因为要知道，大脑没有出路，“你”和“我”也没有出路。我们试图以任何方式改变生活的所有努力，只是让它从根本上保持原样。那么这种超越是如何产生的呢？

考虑以下情况：想象一只毛毛虫，它设定了一个成为蝴蝶的目标。它花费时间想象如何做到这一点，尝试这种方法和那种方法，但似乎没有什么奏效。因为无论它多么努力地想成为蝴蝶，它仍然是一只毛毛虫。

它可能是一个“改进的”或“更好的”毛毛虫，但它的本质仍然是毛毛虫。

现在想象一下，如果我们这只毛毛虫能够思考。如果它能思考，它实际上甚至无法想象成为一只蝴蝶，因为它的唯一经验是作为一只毛毛虫。因此，如果它想到要成为一只蝴蝶，它实际上是在想成为一个更好的毛毛虫。

成为蝴蝶是不可想象的。因此，我们的毛毛虫试图成为蝴蝶的尝试表现为试图作为一个毛毛虫来改善自己的尝试。徒劳的。我们的毛毛虫如何成为一只蝴蝶呢？

需要注意的是，毛毛虫所做的任何事情都不会导致它变成蝴蝶。**大自然会解决这个问题，毛毛虫不需要操心。** 它只需要做一个毛毛虫——而它本来就是——然后转变就会自然发生。

关键在于做一个毛毛虫。如果毛毛虫忙于试图成为蝴蝶或更好的毛毛虫，它就不是简单地做一个毛毛虫。**让它简单地做一个毛毛虫——然后蝴蝶的部分就会自己解决。**




## 第十三章
在毛毛虫的情况下，这并不是问题，因为毛毛虫没有大脑，它没有将自己视为选择者或自我引导者的概念。但在我们的情况下，我们该怎么办呢？我们就是大脑，我们曾经认为自己所是的一切都是大脑。如果大脑决定“就这样存在”，这仍然是大脑的另一个决定，是大脑在生存。而大脑永远无法活在当下，永远无法简单地就这样存在。不，**它非常忙碌地试图到达某个地方**。那么这个悖论如何解决呢？

要回答这个问题，我们必须引入<font color=red>存在或真我的概念</font>。它是我们真正的自我，但它不是“你”或“我”。它与我们认为自己是谁或是什么毫无关系。它与大脑无关，与我们的磁带、模型、程序、旁白、思想、情感、感觉、故事、行为、表现、形而上学或任何关于“你”或“我”的其他东西都无关。不，**它是我们真正的自我。它超越了刺激与反应的世界**。

**<font color=red>真我就像一片空旷的蓝天——广阔、寂静、不变。它是纯粹的意识，纯粹的存在。它没有形状，也不像任何东西。它是现实，但与大脑对现实的故事无关。</font>**

它是真理，但与概念或语言无关。它是美本身，但是一种超越形式或形象的美。它是极乐，但它与通常所认为的幸福无关，因为它没有原因。它是和平、宁静、寂静，但它与人类生活中通常所认为的放松无关。

任何类型的表述都无法真正描述存在、自我或存在本身。<font color=red>它是空虚，是虚无，是任何事物的缺失</font>。它是无法言说的，无法想象的，无法通过任何概念化来达到的。也就是说，我们可以对它进行概念化，但概念化只是胡说八道，因为它与存在或存在本身毫无关系。**存在是无限的，而语言是有限的——这种差距几乎是无法弥合的**。因此，关于它的所有语言和概念从根本上来说都是错误的，因为<font color=red>语言来自一个排除性的语境，而存在并非如此</font>。

让我们直接来看。为了形成任何概念，必须排除某些东西；否则，我们拥有的是整体，是全部，但没有概念。为了形成“铅笔”的概念，我们必须排除“非铅笔”的东西。为了形成“红色”的概念，我们必须排除“非红色”的东西。这就是为什么没有任何心理表述、任何概念体系，无论多么微妙或高尚，能够成为真理。<font color=red>因为概念最终基于局限性、排除性和逻辑——而真理是无限的、非排他的，并且对大脑来说是不合逻辑的</font>。

什么是真理？真理是日落，真理是街上的雨，真理是滴滤的咖啡。它是完整的。真理就像全息图一样，它的每一部分都包含着整体。真理不是部分的总和，无论多少解释都无法达到它；**它就是它所是的样子**。

**什么是真理？真理是一朵玫瑰——不是“玫瑰”这个词，也不是关于玫瑰的任何理论，而是一朵纯粹的玫瑰本身。**我们可以体验玫瑰，我们可以体验现实，我们可以体验真理，但<font color=red>当我们试图用语言表达它时，我们就会扭曲它</font>。我们可以写一百万字来描述在一个温暖的春夜体验玫瑰，但它们甚至无法接近体验本身。

真正看到这一点，就是理解奥修常说的，无知是如此广阔，以至于它永远无法被摧毁。水是什么？科学回答说它是H₂O，是氢和氧。氢是什么，氧是什么？科学回答说它们是质子和电子、物质和能量的某种配置，但这些只是新的名称。

没有人知道电子是什么，没有人知道物质是什么，没有人知道氢是什么，没有人知道水是什么。我们只是增加了一些新的标签和类别，但神秘感仍然深不可测，完全无法穿透。我们的无知是无限的，它永远无法被克服。<font color=red>我们永远无法真正知道任何东西</font>。

既然如此，那么即使是简单的事物本质上也是无法传达的，它们实际上无法被准确地谈论。语言会立即扭曲它们。如果这对水或玫瑰来说是真的，那么对关于存在的语言来说，就更是如此……自我……存在。**当我们谈论它时，我们就陷入了错误、扭曲和虚假之中**。

因此，当我们说存在是真理、极乐或和平时，必须记住，这只是诗歌的语言、隐喻的语言、间接暗示的语言。即使是“存在”或“自我”或“存在”这些词，也只是大脑创造的标签，我们最好不要将它们当作字面意思。

佛教《楞严经》中有一个恰当的短语，那就是<font color=red>所有关于存在的语言和概念都是“指向月亮的手指”</font>。语言只能指示、暗示；它们不是月亮——现实——而只是指向它的手指。

<font color=red>然而，大脑却错过了月亮，专注于手指</font>。大脑钻研哲学、神学、形而上学体系，然后认为存在就是这样那样的。大脑总是错过重点。即使是本文这一段中的概念，也只是沙盒里的玩具。

一个有趣的真实故事：一个求道者曾经来到禅师赵州从谂那里，问道：“什么是佛？谁是佛？他在哪里可以找到？”赵州回答说：“去寺庙里。你会在那里找到佛。”然后那人说：“但是在寺庙里只有一尊石像。你知道，我知道，一尊石像不是佛。”赵州回答说：“你说得完全正确。一尊石像不是佛。”于是那人问道：“那么谁是佛？”赵州回答说：“去寺庙里。你会在那里找到佛。”

一个奇怪的故事。这个求道者看穿了石像的象征意义，但没有看穿其他象征意义。因此，他以为赵州在谈论外在的寺庙。但赵州对外在的寺庙并不感兴趣，他谈论的是内在的寺庙。他在说，**除非我们洞察到心灵的本质，否则我们就会迷失，永远无法发现我们已经是佛了**。

大脑需要刺激；它需要消遣、追逐、寻找。它就像一只蜘蛛，不断地编织，然后被自己的网困住。编织、刺激、活动、寻找都是障眼法，阻止我们洞察这一切的本质。**我们变得像一个在全世界寻找自己鼻子的人。因此，他看不到他已经在寻找的东西了**。

真理是当下的，是前景，但我们看不到它，因为我们正在扫描天空去寻找它。




## 第十四章
心智深陷于象征和故事之中，并将其视为现实和真理。然而，<font color=red>任何可以用语言或符号表达的东西都不是“真实”的；它也不是“虚假”的。相反，它只是有用或无用的</font>。

科学充满了被取代的“真理”例子。最初，光被视为粒子，后来是波；现在它被认为是两者的某种结合。最初，世界被认为是平的，现在它是圆的；总有一天，它可能会以另一种方式被感知。最初，牛顿定律被认为是“真实的”；现在，相对论被认为是“真实的”，总有一天它也会被取代。**没有任何概念、定律或符号关系是最终“真实”的；它只是在有限的时间内有用或无用。**

“这棵树是绿色的”是真的吗？某些振动击中我们的眼睛，我们同意将其标记为“绿色”。我们对振动的另一种解释被标记为“树”。当我们说“这棵树是绿色的”时，我们只是将两个标签组合在一起；**它可能有用，但没有任何真实之处**。将“树”和“绿色”这两个标签组合在一起得到了很多人的认同，但有人可能会不同意——对他们来说，这棵树可能是查特酒绿（一种黄绿色）。

这可能看起来是一个偏门或无关紧要的问题，但它延伸到了我们整个生活。假设我们觉得我们的女朋友很无聊。对我们来说这是真的，但对其他人来说则是假的。假设我们觉得我们的钱不够。对我们来说这是真的——我们的欲望超出了我们所拥有的。但实际上，这是欲望的问题——心智——而不是钱。我们正在创造我们所拥有的钱的体验。

同样，我们正在创造我们生活中的一切体验。这一切都是我们的创造。我们创造了生活中什么是好的、坏的、真实的、虚假的、正确的、错误的、令人向往的和不令人向往的。

**存在不属于这些类别。它只是它所是。它是纯净的、纯粹的、永远新鲜的。它没有过去，没有未来，它只是此时此地。然后心智介入，将自己的磁带和故事强加于它。心智强加了它的判断、评价、区分、二元对立、类别、标签和多样性。它将现实装进盒子里，然后被困在自己的盒子里。它将自己的电影投射到现实的屏幕上，然后生活在电影中。而它深陷痛苦之中，因为它迷失在过去或未来。**

有些地方出了问题，因为<font color=red>幸福是生活的标准</font>。如果我们在生活中的道路给我们带来深刻的幸福和持久的喜悦，那么这就是正确的道路。但仔细看看，让我们诚实地问自己：<font color=red>**我们生活中有多少时刻体验到了如此深刻的狂喜和平静，以至于我们不再渴望任何其他东西？几次？**</font>

如果幸福是标准——而它确实是——那么我们没有达到目标。出了什么问题？我们继续修复事物、改进、解决问题——而我们的处境仍然相同。

看到这一点，我们开始审视问题的根源——心智本身——而不是树叶。一旦我们开始直接洞察心智的骗局，我们会感到惊讶、目瞪口呆，不明白为什么我们还要带着这个疯子。

因为<font color=red>是我们作为自我、存在本身在带着心智</font>。不是我们认同的自我——我们的思想、情感、态度、观点等——因为这些都是心智。不，是我们作为存在本身在带着它。

**让我们保持警觉，因为心智会立即试图将“自我”“存在”装进盒子里。**心智会创造出它是什么的图像，它看起来是什么样子的图像：无限空间、白光、蓝光、黑暗、纯能量、永恒等等。这些都没有错，但它们也没有对。这些符号都不能当真，因为它们只是指向月亮的手指。

还有许多这样的符号，反映了那些已经觉醒的人试图传达不可传达的东西。

有一个被称为正向途径（via positive）的传统，其中存在被赋予了我们一直在使用的标签，如存在、自我、现实、整体、永恒、无限、意识、真理。这些并不是存在的不同方面，而只是对同一事物的不同标签。然而，因为这些正向标签使用了描述性的形式，它们具有欺骗性，往往会被人字面上理解。

为了避免这种倾向，一些其他传统采用了负向途径（via negative），在提及存在时，通过指出它不是什么来描述。

因此，在《奥义书》中有一段著名的文字，<font color=red>将存在描述为“不是这个，不是那个”</font>。

无论我们使用什么描述，它都不是那个。这似乎更接近一些。因为提及存在就像向一个天生失明的人描述蓝色一样：它是响亮的吗？不是。它是柔软的吗？不是。它是粗糙的吗？不是。它是光滑的吗？不是。它是甜的吗？不是。它是芳香的吗？不是。它是旋律的吗？不是。说它不是什么在某种意义上比试图说它是什么更准确。

因此，在这些传统中提及存在时，它被赋予了诸如虚无、空性、虚空、深渊等名称。这些标签的优点是，它们不会暗示任何特定的属性，让心智可以抓住，因为所有属性都被否定了。另一方面，心智甚至可以将“虚无”或“空性”字面上理解——因此，记住即使是负向标签也不是真正的或准确的，这是有益的。

另一种接近存在或存在的方法是将其称为一、非二元或唯一。

当心智看待世界时，它通过其区分的眼镜，看到许多独立的实体——包括它自己——都在为生存而挣扎。然而，这只是一个表象。

在表面之下，存在是一个整体；它是一。<font color=red>在这个层面上，没有任何斗争，因为斗争的存在必须有二元对立</font>；斗争必须是为了某件事或反对某件事。

但是，<font color=red>唯一是万物；它不排斥任何东西，不渴望任何东西，不寻求任何东西，不反对任何东西</font>。那么，怎么可能有斗争呢？存在在玩耍，它喜欢从不同的角度看待自己……不同的实体。而这种玩耍或勒拉（lila）的一部分是，那些具有意识的观点想象自己是独立的实体。




## 第十五章
想象一下一片海洋……海面上波浪起伏。每一波浪升起，存在一段时间，然后又回落到它起源的海洋中。现在想象一下，每一个波浪都有它自己独立存在的观念。自然地，每个波浪都会关心生存，关心如何继续存在下去的问题。

请注意，这个问题是无解的，因为事实上，波浪迟早会停止存在。但这只是在波浪的层面上才是一个问题，波浪试图作为一个独立的个体继续存在。波浪执着于它的独立性，这正是它的问题所在。请注意，在海洋的层面上，没有任何问题，因为海洋既不是诞生也不是消亡。它也没有试图生存。它只是存在。

同样要注意的是，波浪从未真正与海洋分离过。事实上，即使我们称它为“波浪”，也在我们的脑海中将它分离开来，但事实上只有海洋。即使波浪认为它是独立的，它也不是。试图生存的行为延续了它对独立性的感觉，但实际上它从未独立过。<font color=red>只有海洋</font>，它在表面上演变和改变着形式，却始终保持着不变。

实际上，波浪唯一的问题在于它试图解决一个根本不存在的问题。<font color=red>一旦它放弃了生存的问题，它就达到了海洋的层面</font>，在那里没有任何问题。在那个层面上，只有存在的宁静与幸福。

**波浪本就是海洋；它不需要通过任何努力来成为海洋。它本来就是海洋。它唯一的问题在于它的幻觉，认为它需要实现某事，需要到达某个地方，需要开辟道路，需要生存。从波浪的层面到海洋的层面的转变可以在瞬间发生；它不需要时间，因为不需要改变或实现任何东西。一切都已经就绪，除了波浪放下它珍视的独立幻觉。**

但请注意，<font color=red>波浪自己无法放下这种独立的幻觉</font>。独立性是它对自己存在的认知方式；它怎么可能放下自己呢？同样，心智感觉自己是独立的，而且永远会感到独立；这是它的本性。独立性就是它的存在；它无法看穿自己。

但如果<font color=red>心智以某种方式消失了，那么就不存在任何问题</font>。那时，存在、本体从那个空的容器中闪耀出来，它在没有任何心智阻碍的情况下体验自己。它一直都在那里。当心智消失时，存在就在那里。它自然地存在，因为它从未不存在过。

可以用一个灯泡被泥土包裹的比喻来说明。光在那里，但由于泥土的阻挡，它无法被看见，无法被体验到。<font color=red>移除泥土，那一直存在的光就会显现出来</font>。

另一个比喻是阳光在阴天照耀。如果云层覆盖天空，太阳就看不见，但它仍然在那里。这就是我们的处境。那些云层就是思想、故事、磁带。移除一片云，太阳就能稍微被看见一点。再移除一片云，太阳就能被看得更清楚一点。

太阳透过云层的缝隙被看见，就像存在或本体透过心智的思想/磁带的缝隙被体验到一样。随着更多的缝隙打开，神秘变得更加可及，可以说——姑且这么说——自我觉醒了。但心智本身无法打开这些缝隙，因为任何尝试都会成为另一种磁带，又多了一层云的阻碍。

说存在或自我觉醒，可能会给人一种印象，认为每个人都有一个独立的自我或存在。但不是这样，<font color=red>只有心智是独立的</font>；这就是为什么它们是幻觉。<font color=red>存在始终是一体的</font>。**换一种说法，我的真实自我和你的真实自我是同一个自我。只有一个自我，一个存在，一个本体，一个海洋。**在《奥义书》中说，阿特曼即梵——**个体灵魂就是存在，就是整体。只有唯一的存在**。

**这对心智来说是非常令人失望的，因为心智希望通过个体灵魂或本质的观念在物理死亡后继续生存，认为它会进入天堂或投胎到新的身体中，或者别的什么。但天堂、地狱以及我们对来世的任何渴望，其实都存在于当下**。“天国就在你们心中”，耶稣说。<font color=red>正是存在本身在新的形式中重生。</font>

**存在不断以新的形式呈现，事物的表面不断变化，就像海洋的表面始终处于运动之中。但在其下，一切都是不变的、寂静的、静止的。我们真正的自我就像天空一样广阔而开放。我们真正的自我不会死亡，因为它从未诞生过。**

另一方面，心智的所有方面仅仅是表面的，注定要消亡。我们以为自己是的一切，我们所执着的一切——我们的态度、情感、思想、记忆、模式、观点——都会像盛开的玫瑰或海上的波浪一样必然消逝。

我们所认为的重要的、独特的自我都是短暂的，会像秋天的树叶一样迅速凋零。心智的问题是无法解决的。它试图生存，但它做不到。而与此同时，它的努力和挣扎使它陷入痛苦之中，它用短暂的满足感来掩盖这种痛苦。这种例行公事，这种日常循环——吃饭、睡觉、工作、放松、提升，所有这些都作为达到某种目的的手段——这就是我们所称的生活。

所以，生活的问题只能被超越，而无法被解决。心智试图解决它、改善它、改变它、让它变得更好的所有努力，只会使问题更加严重。然而，这个问题是可以被超越的。发生的事情是，存在从一场梦中醒来，可以说，它发现自己是海洋，而不是波浪。

**梦中的问题不需要解决。觉醒就足够了。然后，梦消失了，那个无解的问题也随之消失。**




## 第十六章

但这种觉醒，这种超越是如何实现的呢？如果心智没有做到这一点，如果确实没有所谓的“做”，那么它是如何发生的呢？为了回答这个问题，让我们从另一个角度来审视心智：

在每一个瞬间，心智都在运行其刺激-反应程序——磁带、思想、故事。这些程序被用来描绘现实，将心智想要看到的现实版本投射到存在的屏幕上。为了将这些磁带视为现实，必须不将它们视为磁带——也就是说，必须不注意到它们是在机制内部生成的。磁带必须被看作是“在外面”的；它们必须被看作是真实的世界，是现实，是“事物真正的样子”。

可以使用看电影的类比。<font color=red>如果我们全神贯注于屏幕上播放的故事，我们可能会忘记它并不是真实的</font>。我们可能会感到焦虑或希望，悲伤或喜悦，突然间放映机坏了，屏幕变黑了。然后我们才想起这只是一部电影，它并不是真实的。

同样地，如果在心智的某个“磁带”或程序中，我们突然<font color=red>记起这只是一段磁带</font>，如果我们突然注意到它只是一段磁带——无论它是一段美丽的磁带还是一段丑陋的磁带，但终究只是一段磁带——那么那一刻电影就结束了。程序被揭露为只是一个程序；屏幕可以说已经变黑了。

在那一刻，我们不再将磁带视为现实，因为我们将其视为仅仅是一段磁带，仅仅是一个程序。因为**磁带的目的是将自身呈现为现实**，<font color=red>一旦其缺乏现实性被揭露，程序就会简单地停止运行</font>。磁带消失了。程序、磁带、行为、数字、思想——无论我们称它为什么——它都回到了它原来的地方。**在那一刻的觉知中，不再有心智；只剩下存在。**

谁或什么在觉察呢？心智做不到，因为心智不可避免地被困在它的梦想中，被困在它制造的现实版本中。<font color=red>只有自我，只有存在能够觉察</font>。它是觉知。当自我觉察到那一刻正在运行的特定磁带只是一段磁带，而不是现实，当自我觉察到程序只是一个程序——在那一刻，正在运行的程序就会简单地消失。在那一刻，只有自我，没有心智。从比喻的角度来说，在那一刻，自我已经觉醒，<font color=red>浪花发现它就是海洋</font>。

但在下一刻，另一段磁带会被调用并作为对环境刺激的反应而运行。在这个比喻中，如果自我认同这段磁带并将其视为现实，那么可以说，自我再次被困住了；存在再次被吸入了幻象。它再次陷入了沉睡。它再次与心智、与自动的刺激-反应机制认同。现在，机制的生存程序占据了主导地位。

然后在某个时刻，自我再次觉察到一个程序是一个程序，**觉察到一段磁带只是现实本身的一个投射版本**。磁带消失了；它不能再将自身呈现为真实的。在那一刻，自我可以说再次觉醒了。

就这样，反反复复。自我从漫长的沉睡中短暂地醒来，然后又再次入睡。它再次醒来，却又再次回到睡眠中。一开始，自我只是断断续续地醒来。它就像一个沉浸在生动梦境中的人，试图记起那只是一个梦——而她一旦做到了，当然，梦就不再存在了。它就像一个处于深度幻觉中的人，试图记起幻觉并不是真实的。

一开始，这个过程似乎很困难，因为觉知的时刻*少之又少*。但这只是表象。觉知本身并不困难，因为觉知并不是任何一种“做”的行为。<font color=red>自我并不存在于时间和空间中</font>；它不参与任何活动、努力或奋斗。所以**觉知并不是某种被做的事情；它只是存在。它只是发生了**。

如果对一段磁带的觉知是一种努力，那么它就不是觉知，而是心智所做的事情。因为心智就是关于努力、挣扎和奋斗的；心智永远无法做到无努力，因为它总是以某种方式试图去到它所在之外的地方。

觉知，不属于心智，是无努力的。它发生在整个刺激-反应机制之外，也不是一种活动。<font color=red>它不是主动的，而是被动的</font>。

这种区别可以通过奥修（Osho）提出的一个比喻来看到。想象一下在火车站等待我们的爱人。我们积极地盯着车门；我们在寻找一张特定的脸，我们爱人的脸。我们对其他脸不感兴趣。这是主动觉知。这是心智。**心智在寻找一个结果；它在寻找某种特定的东西**。

现在想象一下坐在秋天的河边，看着河上的树叶漂过。每一片树叶漂过时，都被**毫不费力地注意到**。没有一片树叶比另一片更重要，但也没有一片树叶在没有被注意到的情况下漂过。<font color=red>没有对结果的关注，也没有明确的目标。只有一种无选择的、沉默的观察。</font>**这是被动觉知。这是自我的觉知；事实上，它就是自我。每一片树叶被简单地注意到并放下；对它没有任何关注**。

这就是我们对待自己的磁带、程序、思想、情感、感觉、模型、行为和要求的方式。**我们只是简单地注意到任何出现的、正在运行的东西，带着纯粹的注意力。不添加任何东西；没有评判，没有评价，没有觉得它是好是坏，或者它应该或不应该存在**。

**我们只是允许存在的东西存在，并在没有鼓励或谴责的情况下注意到它。添加鼓励、谴责、评判、评价或任何其他东西，都是对磁带/故事的某种操作，而纯粹的觉知是一种非操作性**。

**我们允许每一片树叶——每一段磁带——进入我们的觉知，不带任何欲望或回避，并允许它离开而不执着或排斥。没有偏好。每个想法被允许进来，也被允许离开。它只是被注意到，不添加任何东西。**如果心智对它添加了某些东西，那么这个添加也被简单地注意到。

**这就像是注意到海上的波浪**。每一波浪从深处升起，被注意到并被允许存在，然后又消失回它所来自的海洋。**这就像是观察天空中的云**。每一片云出现，穿过天空，然后消失。云的存在没有理由；它只是偶然在那里。而当它在那里时，它被默默地观察。我们观察心智中的思想，就像我们观察云在天空中飘过一样。




## 第十七章
根据传统，这被称为觉知、见证或正念。有时它被称为纯粹的注意力或自我记忆。名字并不重要，因为不同的名字背后是同一种现象。**这是一种深刻的允许。这是一种深刻的放下。这是一种对任何存在事物的深刻接受。这是一种对任何存在事物的深刻爱，选择它以它本来的方式存在。这是一种对当下的深刻感恩和庆祝。这是一种对存在事物的深刻观察，既不执着也不回避。**

这棵树有两个主要分支。第一个分支是关于从我们所在的地方开始——在我们的日常生活中。例如，当我们洗澡时，我们通常并不在此刻与它同在；我们并没有意识到水流落在我们身上的美好。相反，我们在思考各种事情，琢磨着这个和那个，为工作或其他事情做准备。通常，我们在洗澡的时候并不只是在洗澡。

在日常生活中运用觉知，例如，意味着注意到我们在洗澡时正在运行的故事/磁带。这意味着注意到是什么阻碍了我们只是与洗澡同在。当我们<font color=red>注意到这些磁带</font>时，我们既不拒绝它们，也不鼓励它们。

我们对它们不做任何事情。这只是注意到它们是磁带，头脑在运动。我们接受它们，允许它们存在，选择它们在那里，但不是作为一种积极的行为。相反，接受是隐含在觉知本身中的。当我们注意到这些磁带只是磁带，运动只是运动时，磁带就变得更加虚幻——然后我们就只是在洗澡，没有其他事情。

当我们把一个故事当作现实而不是一个故事来看待时，就好像我们被溪流中的一片树叶迷住了，并且现在随着它顺流而下。**我们的注意力被抓住了；我们紧紧抓住不放**。然后我们生活在将那个想法当作现实所产生的现实版本中。然后**我们通过执着于某种有限的东西而错过了现实本身**。相反，当我们以一种超脱的方式简单地观察每个磁带的来去，没有任何偏好时，我们就到达了<font color=red>精神的入口——当下的时刻</font>。

当佛陀谈到执着是痛苦的根源时，可能会出现执着于物体或人的形象。的确，我们确实会执着于人和物体。但我们之所以这样做，是因为我们对自己讲述的故事。

<font color=red>如果没有关于我们对人或物体的故事的执着，我们就无法执着于人或物体</font>。这才是佛陀真正所说的执着。而这种执着意味着将那种信念或故事视为现实。如果在对磁带/故事的感知中没有“现实”，那么也就不会有对它的执着。然后它就只是另一种信念或故事，并且会被视为如此。一旦失去了“真实”和“现实”的品质，它就不再吸引我们。

因此，对一个人或物体的执着实际上是由关于它的故事所引发的时刻与时刻的执着。而日常生活的互动和情境往往会引发那些最需要被注意到的磁带。所以**在日常情境中时刻运用正念是一种快速将觉知带入深层执着的方法**。

但同时，安静地坐着，暂时摆脱日常生活的忙碌，以便毫无分心地观察那些从内心深处*冒出来*的磁带，也有很大的价值。<font color=red>在安静地坐着的沉默中，我们可以更容易地意识到头脑的运动</font>。

然后，随着故事逐渐变得更加虚幻，头脑也变得更加虚幻，因为头脑除了它的故事之外什么都不是。然后<font color=red>现实开始更多地通过我们流动</font>。

这两种方法相互补充得很好。在安静的时刻和日常生活中运用觉知都很有帮助。当它们一起使用时，它们打开了一扇共同的门——头脑的逐渐消失。

在禅宗中，这种消失被称为无心。在这种状态下，所有的二元对立、所有的模型、所有的信念、概念、限制、要求、排斥、立场和现实版本都被超越了，因为没有头脑来维持它们。在这种产生的空虚中，存在可以通过我们越来越多地演奏它的旋律，就像呼吸通过一支空心的笛子一样。




## 第十八章
当我们仔细审视我们赋予意义的故事、我们所持有的立场时，我们会发现某些故事或立场会反复出现。我们每个人的生命中都有主导的主题或主导动机，而我们每个人反复创造某些情境、运行某些“录音带”、占据某些立场，这绝非偶然。

这类似于一种催眠后暗示。假设有人对我们进行催眠，并植入一种催眠后暗示，即每当他扬起眉毛时，我们就会渴望一碗汤，但我们不会记得这个暗示。催眠结束后，我们会感觉完全正常。我们和催眠师在交谈，比如说，当他突然扬起眉毛时，我们会立刻渴望一碗汤。为了合理化这种渴望，我们可能会提到一些关于现在是午餐时间之类的事情。

请注意，我们用来合理化这种渴望的理由与冲动本身毫无关系。我们渴望汤是因为催眠后暗示。然而，我们还会加上一个旁白、一个声音旁白、一个故事或关于为什么我们现在渴望汤的合理化。也就是说，我们会为我们的冲动找到理由。这就是大脑所做的事情之一。

不仅如此，我们还会觉得自己现在选择喝一碗汤是因为午餐时间到了，而事实上，我们正在机械地重演一种情境，这是一种纯粹的刺激-反应行为。

如果我们一生都围绕着那些经常扬起眉毛的人，我们会发现自己频繁地渴望一碗汤。在每次喝汤的情况下，<font color=red>我们都会觉得自己选择了这样做，我们对它做出了决定</font>。

在每次喝汤的情况下，我们的大脑都会提供一个理由，解释为什么我们在那一刻选择喝汤。而每次的理由都是完全无关的，因为我们喝汤纯粹是一种刺激-反应行为——然而，我们会觉得自己是决策者、控制者、选择者。

这将成为我们生活中的主导主题。我们会被认为是一个特别喜欢汤的人，一个在各种不同情境下都享受一碗汤的人。如果有人问我们为什么这么喜欢汤，我们会给出一些理由，而这些理由是完全无关的。然而，我们会将自己呈现为——并且觉得自己是一个因为这些理由而选择在我们的生活中拥有这种汤的主题的人。而这将是一个幻觉。

难道不能通过植入适当的催眠后暗示组合，在某人身上创造出任何神经症、强迫症、模式、痴迷、精神病或性格障碍吗？是的。为什么这很重要？因为<font color=red>生命早期的经历本质上就像催眠后暗示</font>。

当我们经历生存受到深刻威胁时的冲击和痛苦，无论是身体上的还是情感上的，那么当时存在的任何“暗示”都会像催眠后暗示一样被烙印在我们的脑海中。尽管被遗忘，但它们会以同样的方式影响我们。

例如，一对夫妇在争吵时非常激烈，一个小女孩在旁边观看。丈夫愤怒地离开，不小心撞到了婴儿，而妻子在他背后低声咒骂：“你这个混蛋！”婴儿从争吵的暴力和父亲暂时离开几天中感受到了生存的威胁。

然而，婴儿的大脑注意到自己幸存了下来。根据原始大脑的逻辑，因此，幸存是通过一场争吵，父亲离开了才实现的。婴儿接收到的“催眠后暗示”是，像父亲那样的人——比如说，高个子、深色头发的男人——是混蛋，而通过与这样的人建立关系并让他离开，就可以幸存下来。而在后来的生活中，这个婴儿长大后的女人正是这样做的。在每次这样的情况下，她都会有出色的理由来解释事情为什么会这样发展。当然，这些理由看起来像是现实；它们看起来像是真相。

荒谬吗？是的。毫无意义吗？是的。具有破坏性吗？是的。<font color=red>但对于大脑来说，有利于生存吗？是的</font>。大脑将这种行为等同于生存，并会反复创造这种情境以“生存”。<font color=red>环顾四周，我们会看到人们（包括我们自己）在他们的生活中反复创造重复的模式</font>。

这些模式在我们的生活中是绝对没有滋养性的，然而我们都被困在其中，紧紧抓住它们——并且紧紧抓住我们那些关于生活为什么会这样或那样的出色理由。

观察那些主导我们生活的重复主题和模式：有些人把生活过得非常努力但总是差一点成功。有些人总是习惯性地成为这样或那样的受害者。有些人变成了慢性抱怨者、无聊的愤世嫉俗者或义愤填膺的斗士。

有些人把生活过得像是要先发制人地对付别人。有些人总是面带微笑，但内心感到孤独。有些人通过自我牺牲来让别人产生内疚。有些人把自己塑造成一个不断重复的悲剧的中心人物。有些人通过“表现得很活跃”来避免真正与他人在一起。

列举出这些以各种方式主导我们生活的不同主题和模式，几乎是无穷无尽的。而每一个都与关于喝一碗汤的催眠后暗示没有什么不同。每一个都是机械的、自动的——然而却伴随着各种旁白、各种理由和解释。我们被困在这些模式中，就像我们在钢琴上反复强调几个音符一样。

这种自动化的回报是生存，而**生存意味着正确**。例如，那个听到母亲在父亲离开房子时说“你这个混蛋”的婴儿，现在作为一个女人，在潜意识中正在证明男人是混蛋。而当她的每段恋爱关系都因为她的无意行为而突然破裂，那个男人也离开她时，她又得到了“正确”。她可以感到自以为是和自我合理化。“看吧？我说过。男人都是混蛋。”

因为大脑不过是一个由“录音带”、立场、模式、程序、观点——这些只是同一个东西的不同名称——组成的集合，<font color=red>在这些事情上被证明是正确的，就等同于验证了大脑的存在</font>。因为大脑就是它的观点，那么延续它们、运行它们、对它们进行合理化，就是生存本身的行为。**这与延续“我”是相同的**。“你”和“我”通过运行“录音带”、占据立场并证明它们的正确性来生存。

当然，存在一些改善这种情况的方法。回到过去，找到并重新体验那些在生命中烙印下重复模式的事件，会让这种模式停止运行，就像重新体验催眠后暗示被植入的那一刻也会让那个暗示停止一样。这是帕坦伽利的*pratiprasov*方法，在西方则以各种形式的回归分析存在。

另一种方法是有意识地将注意力集中在与生活中重复主题或模式相关的一系列态度、身体感觉、姿势、表情、观点、结论和图像上。从各个方面来看，这是心理治疗的方法，它有助于让我们对我们的模式有一些洞察力，从而减少它们的力量和影响力。

这些方法对于帮助我们适应生活是有价值的。但尽管它们可以缓解我们人类为自己制造的一些问题，但它们无法缓解心灵最深的痛苦，因为它们没有深入洞察心灵的本质，而心灵正是通过认为它的故事有意义而制造了痛苦。

即使这些方法能够处理所有由生存受到严重威胁的事件所建立的模式——这非常不可能，因为这样的事件太多了——它们仍然不会导致无心，不会带来解脱。为什么？因为解脱不是关于你和我；它是从你和我中解脱出来。




## Chapter Nineteen
All methods, all devices can be valuable because they have the potential to begin to rouse us from our slumbers,they can create the critical mass where witnessing begins, they can be a door out of the box in which we spend our life. On the other hand, any method, any device can become a trap if we become attached to it, if it becomes one more link on the treadmill of improving, changing, seeking, achieving.. .all the material around which the ego condenses.

```
critical mass 临界质量
```

Anything can be the prison, anything can be the firststep into the eternal, into liberation, and it depends upon our willingness to watch. We become enlightened not by what we do or don't do, but by watching what we do or don’t do. If we cling to a method it cannot help us with the real problem. And <font color=red>what is the real problem? That we’re trying to survive and improve something — our separate selves — which at the deepest level are an illusion, which don’t actually exist</font>.

Only awareness doesn’t feed this doingness of the mind,because only awareness is not an activity and doesn’t keep the mind's motion going. Only awareness is silent, effortless, passive, not of the mind. Only awareness <font color=red>cuts at the root by watching the very nature of mind itself</font>.

For example, let's suppose we're running a tape that men are bastards and thereby creating a situation where our current lover will leave us, making us right again. Good; let’s not change anything. Let’s <font color=red>simply watch this process without encouragement or condemnation or any evaluation at all</font>.

Let’s simply watch as we set up the situation. Let’s watch as we create ourself being right. Let’s watch as we tell ourself that men are bastards. As we watch, these tapes will start losing force, they will start disappearing of their own accord. We don’t need to do anything. Indeed, anything we do is simply another tape.

We just become a witness to our positions, patterns,presentations. <font color=red>We notice them as positions now instead of as reality</font>. We see that our version of reality is being generated internally moment-to-moment by the automatic programs of the mind.

“That bastard!” If we’re running that tape, for example,what’s real for us is that he’s a bastard — until we notice that it’s just a story, a position, an automatic product of the mind. Actually, he just did whatever he did; that is what is. On top of that we add our interpretations, judgments, programs, etc.and project them out there.

We see wrongness out there and want to change it or be mad about it or whatever. But once we see that wrongness —and rightness too — is being manufactured internally by the mind’s survival programming, and that it’s merely the mind dreaming, then the wrongness and the rightness, the labels and interpretations and acts gradually disappear.

Then we can simply be with what’s there — a child, a flower, a tax form, a lover, a sunset. **In that moment there are no obstacles between us and Existence in all Its many forms**.The very obstacles become channels.

Without awareness we suffer even if all is seemingly okay on the surface. There’s nothing wrong in that, but we pay a price. The cost is being frozen in our mechanical series of presentations. The cost is being dead while we’re still alIive,dragging along, acting out programmed dramas.

```
dragging along 拖着，得过且过
```

Dragging along in life is heart-wrenching. For <font color=red>the cost of dragging along is missing the mystery and loveliness of Existence</font>. Existence is knocking, but we’re not at home to answer the door.

Instead we’re off with our stories, dreaming with them,hypnotized by them. We can miss our own life in this way. We can miss the wholeness, the fulfillment, the effortlessness, the bliss that is waiting. We can miss experiencing ourself as the Ocean and not the wave. We can stay entangled in a fight for survival, security, pleasure, rightness.

Let’s become a witness to the mind in our daily life.Let’s become aware. Let’s let everything be grist for the mill. **Let’s observe our thoughts coming and going just as we might observe cars on the street coming and going**. And in addition,<font color=red>using whatever posture allows us to forget the body without becoming sleepy, let’s take some time out each day to just sit quietly with no activity</font>. In the stillness and silence of sitting quietly, the mind will come to seem more and more flimsy,distant. And one day it will simply be gone.

A question: If awareness is not a doingness of any kind,how do we start? How do we get it to begin? <font color=red>Actually its there already, so beginning is really a matter of allowing it to be there</font>. **Its simply an allowing**. It just happens when we’re aware that it will.

**Many things happen which we don’t understand. And there’s no need to understand them**. Let’s watch. How do we eat? By moving our hand with its utensil to our mouth. Yes,but how do we get our hand to move? By contracting the muscles in our arm. Yes, but how do we contract the muscles in our arm? By sending down a nerve impulse from the brain?And how do we do that? **Ultimately, we don't know how we accomplish even a simple thing like eating. We just eat. It just happens.**

When we look deeply we see that everything in our life is like this. Things happen, but at the deepest level we don't know how.

Awareness is the same. It begins by itself, and we won’t understand it. We can just allow it. We just become a witness to our own movement. There are no instructions.



# Opening

## Chapter Twenty
We're always seeking. That might be the best definition of a human being: the seeker. We're looking for ways to survive, to be secure and powerful, to be gratified and fulfilled. As we have seen, the mind normally never stops seeking. It is its very nature.

In sum, <font color=red>each of us has certain stimulus-response programs which are predominant and which determine what can be called our prevalent theme or pattern or racket in life. It is our predominant attitude</font>.

For some of us the habitual response may be anger. For others the habitual tone might be cynicism. Some of us have a life which is about trying very hard. For some the habitual one is grief. Some of us stuff down our emotions and become very monotone. Many other examples could be given.

The tone is not always apparent, but is always there as an undercurrent. Our predominant theme or pattern in life is our mode of survival moment-to-moment, <font color=red>our unconscious method of coping</font>. According to our programming, it is how we seek to survive.

Along with this predominant pattern or survival-mode,each of us has a predominant method or complex of methods for seeking happiness. This is how we feel we can achieve fulfillment, completion, satisfaction. It’s our dream, our search.It’s our path. If the survival-mode is our way of seeking to avoid the stick, then this is our predominant way of seeking the carrot. It’s the rainbow on the horizon for us.

It takes many forms. To some of us, happiness means obtaining enough money — and of course, “enough” is almost always a bit more than what is available. For others, the lure is power. For still others, fame or notoriety. Some dream of achieving a life situation where ever-new sensual experiences can be created. Belief in a movement or cause or way of life is the carrot for some, and the hope is for the triumph of that movement or cause.

Or the path can take a more down-to-earth form. The right degree will make us happy. Fulfillment will be achieved when the perfect lover or soulmate is found.. .or married.. .or remarried. To some of us, the holy grail is good health. To others, the advancement of the arts. To be able to retire. The list is endless.

<font color=red>Our path here is that which we think of as bringing happiness once it is perfectly achieved</font>. Once it is perfectly achieved, we tell ourselves, all seeking will end. It will be enough. Of course, there are always barriers or obstacles to the achievement, otherwise that which is being sought would already be here. So the mind’s thinking runs something like this: “Once I get this, I'll be happy.” “As soon as I get over the hump, I'll relax.” “Once I get past these obstacles, I'll be able to enjoy myself.”

Now the interesting thing is that sometimes we do reach our goal. We achieve what we wanted to achieve. And what happens? We’re gratified for a little while. But then we make an interesting discovery. We discover that our achievement is perhaps not enough after all. We find that we still feel a gnawing dissatisfaction.

And we even see the cause of it. It is because we over-looked something, something that we very much need to be happy. Whatever this something is to us — the right job, the right place to live, the right man or woman, whatever — we now set off to achieve it.

And so the search continues. It has to be so, for that is the nature of mind. What we’ve done is to exchange our old path for a new path. Before, let’s say, what was most important was the spread of the movement we were involved in. Now we know that that was not quite correct. Now, let’s say,we know that the most important thing is to own our own house. And so we have a new path now, a new rainbow-goal to reach.

Each new path starts out as a fragrance, as a game, as something pleasant to pursue. It ends in misery and suffering,as we become more and more attached to our path. Before, we were like a dog chasing its tail. Now once again, we’re chasing our own tail. The only difference is that since the tail is now decorated a little differently we think it’s a different game. As our attachment grows and we whirl around faster we descend further into suffering. We don’t have what we want, or we’re afraid of losing what we have.

<font color=red>If our attachments cause suffering, why do we cling to them? Because all our attachments feel comfortable on the surface. We like our attachments. We get a payoff from them. We get a sense of certainty from them, a sense of comfortable familiarity, a sense of being right. We identify with them.</font>

As the master Adyashanti says, we get a thrill from our desires; that’s why we follow them. <font color=red>**We enjoy the excitement of wanting something; if the excitement of wanting were not there we might start losing track of who we are.**</font> When the freedom of emptiness starts staring us in the face, it can be very scary. We go back to our wantings and attachments and identities as to a safe refuge.

We feel a desire or an attachment as part of us, as a part of our identity, as our point of view. We cling because our path is our hope of happiness, it is what we think will make us feel good. No wonder we can't imagine giving it up. It would be like wrenching out a tooth, only much more so. We feel as if we would be giving up a part of who we are.

<font color=red>And all attachment involves exclusion. It involves the limited, the partial. **We cling to something because we’re afraid to cling to nothing**. The latter would involve insecurity,falling into the abyss, stepping into the Unknown moment-by-moment. We normally shrink back from that. The Totality is scary to our mind because the mind cannot comprehend it. So we cling to the partial, missing the bliss of the Whole.</font>



## Chapter Twenty-one
Beneath the comfort and certainty on the surface is tension and anguish, which is the hidden part of the iceberg, buried deep in the unconscious part of the mind because we normally don’t want to be aware of it. Yet it’s there, and in unguarded moments we allow ourselves to feel it. Our attachments cause us to live in the future, missing the moment. We live in our dreams, missing the enoughness of Reality, missing the suchness of Existence.

**The mind is like a thirsty person who dreams of drinking water but doesn’t drink it, thinking that the dreams will slake the thirst. Or it’s like a person who studies all about water and imagines that knowledge of water is the same as drinking it. The mind is like a hungry person who instead of eating is always reading the menu. It imagines the delights of eating, but doesn’t eat. It dwells in its stories.**

What is the way out of this dilemma? Every seeking for a new answer, each renewed search for happiness only keeps us stuck in tension and suffering. Do we then forcibly give up our attachments? Do we reject them, run away from them? It doesn’t work. <font color=red>To reject something is still to be attached to it;it’s just the opposite side of the same coin</font>.

The attachment is still running us; we're still at the effect of it. That is why force doesn’t work, because it doesn't really alter anything. It alters the arrangement, but not the inner essence.

For instance, if we force ourselves to give up cigarette smoking we’ll still be at the effect of cigarettes. We’ll crave them and the attachment will show up in other areas. We may chew gum or eat candy. We might be nervous, irritable. We might yell at our family, or gain weight, or whatever.

When an attachment is renounced we’re still attached;otherwise what is the point of the renunciation? 

Then the attachment will simply move somewhere else. It will take a new form. The energy of the attachment remains, because energy can neither be created nor destroyed. It simply moves. If it does not move upward into greater consciousness then it will move into a new attachment.

<font color=red>The unfoldment of freedom is awareness</font>. All doingness, all attempts to do something about our attachments lead only deeper into the mind, because all doingness is of the mind. Only awareness is not a doingness, not a new goal. We simply see that we’ve gotten caught again, and the nature of what has caught us. No need to reject the attachment, which wouldn’t work anyway — a doingness. No, <font color=red>we just see it. Then the unattachment happens. The tape disappears</font>.

Each new path is like a drug trip. It feels good at first,we get high on it. But after a while it becomes obsessive; we cling just to avoid coming down. “I'll be able to relax as soon as I achieve such-and-such.”

Awareness is seeing that this version of reality — the one we’re running now — isn’t reality either but just another story,another dream. It’s seen and accepted for what it really is. And in that moment of clear-sighted seeing the dream loses its force; it is transcended. Suddenly it drops away from us, like a toy from a maturing child. We didn’t reject anything. Just in the observation, things can fall away — or stay.

As the current clinging either falls away through awareness or is rejected because of disillusionment, it is replaced by a new path to happiness. The illusory nature of all paths, all searches, all doingness isn’t apparent right away.So we couldn’t find the door out of the room that way,now we look for it this way. We become aware, perhaps, of the illusory nature of that path, but now we get sucked into this one. So our life can be a series of substitutions, continuing to substitute new dreams for the old ones.

No path is ultimately “bad” or “good”; there is nothing intrinsically wrong or right about any path per se. **Setting up goals and paths is what mind does — that’s what is. To reject that process would be like rejecting a cloud — foolish.**

```
per se  [ˌpɜːr ˈseɪ] 本身;本质上
```

We see the story/tape for what it is, then we’re nolonger fascinated by it. We include it, make room for it,choose it to be that way, love it for what it is. Then it becomes flimsy, it becomes less relevant, it stops running our life.

The path is never the problem. It is not the path but our 9 that keeps us trapped. All paths are good not only for whatever value is there, but also in the sense that they provide opportunities to see through them too.

All devices, all the rapies can be useful. All are channels to Reality as our awareness becomes more real. Awareness makes our moment-to-moment living — just as it is — the road to heaven.




## Chapter Twenty-two
If we're fortunate, we sooner or later begin to see that all materialist paths — that is, all paths that involve trying to manipulate our environment — do not lead to happiness. Then our search takes on a spiritual form. This is very significant,and it opens up a danger too, because <font color=red>attachments to spiritual paths are more difficult to see as attachments</font>.

Now we’re searching for enlightenment or heaven or God or no-mind or whatever the name is. As Osho points out, this is the same movement. Again, we become attached to our path, to our method. The attachment now may be to a teacher or leader. It may be to forms and rituals and dogma,or to a particular growth or consciousness movement.

It may be to a particular organization of seekers. It may be to a set of consoling beliefs, or to sacred scriptures. The attachment may be to beautiful or terrible images encountered during meditation, or it might be to psychic powers developed in such meditations. Inevitably there’s a certain metaphysical formulation involved, a certain way of looking at things, and we can become attached to that.

```
metaphysical [ˌmetəˈfɪzɪkl] 形而上学的
```

The attachment may be to serving others or to saving the world. It may be to a certain way of acting — very loving,or very high, or very surrendered. It may be to the rapture found in certain absorption states. All such attachments are accompanied by an attitude of “I’ve found it” or “I know the right way.”

Thus we may become also attached to proselytizing — not seeing that attachment to converting others covers over a deep doubt within. Otherwise, what is the need? Otherwise,we simply share what we have like a flower sharing fragrance. There’s no concern about the outcome, there is no compulsion to convert others.

```
proselytizing [ˈprɑːsələtaɪzɪŋ] 传教
```

<font color=red>Spiritual attachments are more difficult to drop than material ones precisely</font> because they’re less dense, less solid,more transparent and thus more difficult to see. It can be more difficult to see them as a dream, as just more of the mind’s tapes, as just more of the mind’s clingings.

Very often our spiritual metaphysics is associated with very reverential thoughts, very sublime conceptions. They feel better than material attachments. We feel now that we’ve left illusion behind and are on the true road. **How, we ask, can these sublime thoughts and feelings possibly be just more tapes and stories? Yet they are. It is still the mind engaged in the old game of surviving by trying to get somewhere, and clinging to something as a means.**

When awareness happens in this moment, then seeking drops for a moment, the tapes disappear for a moment. And what is left is nothing, silence. <font color=red>For in that moment of awareness there is no mind, since the mind is just tapes, thoughts. When there are no tapes there is no mind either</font>.

In that moment there’s only silence. In this silence we encounter the Existence. It is already there waiting, but we are not silent, we are not absent, so there’s no experience of It. **Actually, it’s not accurate to say that we experience/encounter Existence, since the Existence is always subject, never object, and since in that moment of awareness “you” or “I” are not there. Only the Existence is there. It encounters Itself.**

The goal of all meditation, all prayer, all spiritual paths is simply to reach this point of silence where the mind is not. Each method is beautiful in itself in that it **quiets the mind**, it gives us a taste, but then we become attached to the method and in this way the mind survives.

Also, all methods are a doingness and they presuppose that there is some goal we’re trying to reach. Methods can be extremely useful in freeing ourselves from other attachments,**but ultimately all methods must themselves be transcended**.Unless awareness happens along with the methods, we simply continue the same game of the mind at a more subtle level.Only awareness is not a method, not a trap because it’s not an activity of any kind, and does not involve trying to change anything.

For instance, surrendering to a lover or an avatar is very beautiful. To surrender is to love, it means making the other more important than oneself. It suppresses many programs and stories because *to the extent* that one surrenders one has no goals other than to be surrendered, to be in love. It gives us a taste of Existence, of bliss because the controller becomes mostly and temporarily absent.

But who is it that makes the decision to be surrendered? The mind, for all decisions are of the mind. Behind the act of surrender is the mind, active and well. And too, we can become attached to the object of our surrender, and this also is of the mind.

The act of surrendering is a drug, a program, another dream — a subtle and beautiful one. Nevertheless its effects are not permanent because they have not involved a deep awareness of the nature of the mind itself. The tapes are suppressed but not extinguished, and will return when one falls out of love, when one is no longer surrendered.

Prayer is beautiful, because it too is a form of surrender.It acknowledges that there is something greater than who we think we are, and thus the act of prayer by its very nature is an act of humility, of surrender.

```
Prayer is a form of surrender <= It acknowledges that there is something greater than who we think we are
```

Yet, what is the mind’s ultimate defense of itself? It is to set up something which is other-than-itself. The notion of a God that can be prayed to presupposes that She is separate from us in some way. It also presupposes the existence of that which is praying. In the very humility and surrender of the act of prayer can be a subtle strengthening of the mind. Can we hear ourself praying? If so, God has heard it.

Guided imagery is another method, a kind of mental motion picture, a visual story in the mind. It is very beautiful and powerful as a device for therapy, for goal-achieving, for relaxation. It can be a preliminary act to meditation. Guided“meditation” is often confused with meditation itself, but it’s not. It’s actually a kind of guided day dreaming.

Both prayer and guided imagery are still mind-motions,one with ideas and the other with images. Prayer is noisy still,it’s a mental talking. Guided imagery is the visual form of this,a visual occupation, something it shares with hallucinogenic drugs. Except for Teresa of Avila’s “prayer of quiet,” both can keep the mind involved in its doingness. This can also be so of affirmations — another kind of mind-occupation.

```
hallucinogenic [həˌluːsɪnəˈdʒenɪk] 致幻剂
```

All things have their uses at the appropriate time. All is exactly as it should be. And it’s also so, as the saying goes, that“**when we give it all up we get it all back.**”




## Chapter Twenty-three
Meditation, on the other hand, gradually quiets the mind. It is more powerful than prayer or guided imagery or affirmations since it marks a turning point — the first step from talking to listening, from visualizing to watching. To do this, meditation makes use of a particular quality of the mind, which is that the mind can only focus on one thing at a time. <font color=red>It can and does move very rapidly from one thing to another, but at a given instant it can only be occupied with one thing</font>.

If, then, the mind is held to a single object, other things are excluded. So meditation can be one-pointedness, keeping the mind focused and concentrated on one object. <font color=red>When attention wanders from the object we just gently bring the attention back to it. And we do so without condemning our wandering, for to do so would be to wander again</font>. **Meditation does not involve thinking or feeling about the object in anyway. We just focus on the object without adding anything.**

The object of meditation can be almost anything. It can be a mantra or a mandala, an internal image or sound, or an unanswerable question or paradoxical statement (a koan). It can be a picture of an avatar or a particular movement or pose by the body (tai-chi, sufi dancing, yoga). The object can be pain or the breath or a pair of eyes (tratak); it can be a candle flame, the sky, a rock or a flower. The object itself is not all that important. What makes the difference is holding one’s attention to it.

A well-developed meditation prevents our tapes from surfacing and thus quiets down the mind. It can give a taste of Reality by keeping tapes and programs out of consciousness.That taste can be a real eye-opener and can **spur our efforts on the spiritual path**. And meditation can bring about states of intense rapture, referred to as absorption levels or *jhanic* states.It can bring about lovely, exquisite images. It can bring about psychic powers of various kinds.

```
psychic [ˈsaɪkɪk] 通灵的;心灵的;关于通灵的;超自然的;有特异功能的;灵魂的
```

There are many possibilities for attachment here. We can see white lights, blue lights, hear heavenly sounds and see forms of incomparable beauty. We can meet the Buddha or Christ and have a conversation. That is why Zen people call this “going to the movies.” If we become attached to these images and sounds, then we’re simply on a sensuous mind-trip once more, for all images and sounds are mind.

Still more addictive are the psychic powers one might develop. If we meditate very intensely for a long time, especially in certain ways, then psychic powers can occur. We can develop the ability to leave our body, to foretell the future, to read minds. It is a rare person who will not become attached to such powers and others once developed. Yet ultimately it’s just another power trip on a more subtle level. It’s still the mind working and in motion.

Seductive too are experiences of rapture in jhanic states,brought about by prolonged and intense meditations. They are states of vast ecstasy, quite overshadowing what normally passes for pleasure in our life.

```
ecstasy [ˈekstəsi] 摇头丸;狂喜;入迷;陶醉;迷幻药
```

<font color=red>The state of each successive jhana is less exciting, more subtle and still than the one below</font>. We reach each higher jhanic state by being willing to let go of the grosser rapture of the one below. We see that rapture itself is a disturbance, and <font color=red>we relinquish the more exciting forms of rapture in order to obtain the deeper and more subtle ones. And each higher one can become then the new attachment</font>. But, we may ask, what is wrong with an attachment to rapture?

Nothing is wrong, yet it’s still a clinging to the limited;it’s still of the mind. The mind is still pursuing pleasure. We’ve tasted the saltiness of the ocean but we haven’t entered into it. The changes brought about are temporary, and when the meditation ends the changes slowly fade. Thus we can become attached to the meditation, to retaining the rapture resulting from it.

Concentration meditation, as it’s sometimes called, is a magnificent dream, the most beautiful of all dreams, but still a dream. It’s an exotic drug, the mind drugging itself; **but it’s still a kind of drug and sooner or later we come down from it.It’s no different in essence from other drugs we seek — power,money, fame, sex, knowledge, altered realities, cosmic satoris,saving the world, belonging to a group and so on.**

Concentration meditation <font color=red>is still a doingness, it is still the mind trying to get somewhere</font>.

Why do we meditate? In order to obtain peace, rapture,enlightenment or whatever label we give our goal. **But it is still a goal-process**. And who is doing the meditating, who is keeping the attention concentrated on the object? Observe closely and we see once more the fingerprints of the mind; we see the doingness of the controller.

Concentration meditations effects are only temporary because they don’t involve a deep seeing into the nature of the mind itself. The tapes and programs have been suppressed but they have not disappeared. They are still there, and they will surface again when we come down from this special drug.

```
专注冥想，仍然是一种有为，一种目标导向的行动，仍然属于一种念头的药物。
```

This is a difference between concentration meditation and awareness. <font color=red>Awareness does not suppress anything. On the contrary it welcomes everything, accepts it all, sees everything for what it is. And in that effortless seeing, that seeing which is non-doing and which is not of the mind, the tapes simply begin to dissolve. There is no attempt to change or improve anything. Awareness is identical with a deep acceptance. But neither is there a decision to accept either; rather, acceptance is simply there.</font>

Another way of expressing this is to recall the difference between active and passive awareness. Concentration meditation is an active awareness; it is an intense watching of the door of the train in order to see one’s lover. It’s a doingness; it is pointed in a particular direction. <font color=red>True awareness is totally passive, it is merely watching the leaves go by on the river —choosing none, preferring none, clinging to nothing. It is a silence, **a stillness that dissolves all things**.</font>

Concentration meditation is not necessary, but can be a valuable device. It is useful in that it can create a situation where awareness can begin to happen. In slowing down the mind it slows down the flow of leaves in the river, so to speak,so that a beginning awareness can more readily perceive the gaps between the leaves. But it’s not necessary. The essence of awareness is that we start just where we are, with whatever our present circumstances are.

We do not have to do concentration meditations, **we do not have to go to the mountains, we do not have to change our present situation. We simply do whatever we’re doing, but now with awareness.** We begin where we are. But if we don’t yet see the nature of the mind’s game then concentration meditation can be useful. It creates a situation where awareness can begin spontaneously, and be more penetrating.

```
spontaneously  [spɔnˈtenɪəslɪ] 自发;自然;自动;自然地
```




## Chapter Twenty-four
The same is true of a master. She is not necessary, for <font color=red>the true master is inside us</font>. But the inside master is, in a sense, still asleep, so the outside master is needed. She simply creates situation after situation until we begin to wake up and become aware, until we begin to see the true nature of our situation. She surrounds us with a fragrance to arouse us out of our slumbers and dreams.

Once we begin to become aware, then she assists us to avoid the various traps and attachments that can arise. And a true master eventually assists us to see into the nature of perhaps the greatest attachment of all — the attachment to the master. <font color=red>Ultimately, even the master must be transcended.</font>

A master is not necessary, but desirable. For while we’re asleep we're always dreaming that we’re awake. To dream that we’re awake is the best way to stay asleep. The mind’s best defense is to imagine that it’s already gone, that we’re already awake or enlightened. Without the disturbing fragrance of a master, our slumbers may continue for quite a while.

An interesting attachment is the feeling that we have to save the world. <font color=red>The world doesn’t need saving because it’s already perfect</font>.

As Byron Katie says, How do we know that the way the world is is for the highest good? Because it is that way. How do we know the world should be the way it is? Because it is that way. Simple. “Saving the world” can sometimes lead to force, violence, fanaticism. Immense suffering throughout history has been caused by those of us who were intent on saving the world by converting it to some cause or other.

Let’s observe. We see the mind at work, for this is just another form of doingness, of striving. The feeling that the world needs to be saved somehow is a deep non-acceptance of Existence as it is. It is the mind creating imperfection and wrongness out there and demanding that it be changed out there.

This is the same **disease of living in the future**. Now the whole world must struggle toward some glorious imagined utopia. What is herenow is never enough to the mind. It can never see that nothing needs to be achieved.

But if nothing needs to be achieved, why then does a master bother to teach others? Because the master has no achievement in mind; they’re simply sharing who they are.

A true master is like a flower that has bloomed in the desert. The flower gives off its fragrance not out of some compulsion but because that is its nature, that is what it does. The fragrance will be there whether anyone notices it or not. And there is no choice about it. If someone passes by, the flower does not determine whether it likes the person or not before it shares its fragrance; nor does it ask itself whether it is liked. No, the fragrance is simply there.

And the fragrance is not given off to help you or save you. It is simply there out of the flower’s abundance, out of its bliss and exuberance. The master is the same.

What’s the master doing? Actually, he is not teaching at all, for there’s no doctrine or body of knowledge to convey.That is why a master never really gives an answer, but simply destroys the question. Because he is not out to teach us some knowledge. Instead, he is out to destroy our mind.

The effort of the master is to pull all supports out from underneath us until the mind has no place left to stand. All answers just fill our mind again, so how can a master give us answers? And since he’s not giving answers he’s inexhaustible,he can go on forever. A body of knowledge is limited, but a master is unlimited. He knows nothing; he has attained to perfect ignorance, so he can keep on talking for all eternity and never exhaust the subject.




## Chapter Twenty-five
It’s said that a master is awakened, but what does that mean? What does it mean to be a master? What is this thing awakening? Is it some kind of insight? Is it formulating the final system, achieving the ultimate solution? Is it reaching the final goal?

None of those things. <font color=red>Freedom is seeing that there is no goal at all</font>. It’s the dropping of all goals, of all seeking. It’s the dropping of all attempts to improve, get better or change. But this dropping is not a doingness or decision. Rather, **it is a deep seeing that all attempts to get somewhere in anyway only lead nowhere, that they only lead further into the mind**.

It is seeing that all attempts to solve the problem, to improve, to survive, only perpetuate the problem and deepen it. It is seeing that all such attempts to solve the problem are the problem itself, and that **the problem is an illusion, that it doesn’t exist except as attempts to solve it**. All striving of any kind, therefore, simply falls away.

It is a moment when all doingness simply drops. Not that we drop it. We simply see the true reality of things and in that moment the doingness drops away of itself. This doesn’t mean that we necessarily become inactive.

Instead, it means that **we do whatever we do — without strivingness, without compulsiveness or concern.** We've been chasing our tail in a thousand different ways, whirling around faster and faster. We're dizzy from the chase, insane. Suddenly we see that the tail cannot ever be caught, that **in fact the chasing is the problem** and that there is no problem outside of the chasing.

In that moment we simply stop. All the doingness stops. We simply sit down, take a rest and let the dizziness clear. In fact the dizziness and insanity were *part-and-parcel* of the chasing itself. Now they simply drop when the chasing drops. **We see that we're flowing down the river and have been flowing down the river forever and will be flowing down the river forever.**

```
part and parcel 必要部分；重要的部分
```

**Mind wants to be different, unique, special; it wants to get somewhere, to go in its own direction. So it starts trying not to flow down the river, it starts trying to go upstream. And then the whole river, the whole Existence seems to be against us. We are trying so hard, struggling so valiantly against the river, but the river just keeps pushing us in the direction of the flow. The river seems so implacable, relentless, indifferent to our plight and our struggle. The river seems to be hostile,actively working against our will and our desires.**

Awakening is seeing that we are creating the problem.Its seeing that **the river is not against us, its simply flowing the way its flowing**. And the issue is not whether or not we're going to flow with the river, because we're going to do that in any event. **It is vast, and “you” and “I” are atoms.**`无我`

Rather, the issue really is whether we will struggle or not as we flow down the river. The question is whether we’ll become aware of who is creating the struggle in our life. To the extent that we push against the river the river seems to push back, but the river is not the problem.

<font color=red>If there is awareness moment-to-moment of the mind’s struggles then moment-to-moment they disappear; then we can listen to our inner voice and cease our struggling with the river. We stop struggling with Existence. Then we’re in a deep bliss as we flow down the river. Then we celebrate existence moment-by-moment.</font>

We see that all attempts to improve our struggles are only more struggling. And if we try to stop struggling and try to flow down the river, then we’re in tension. How can we try to flow down the river? We’re already doing it. <font color=red>It’s just a deep let-go</font>, there’s no trying or efforting. All trying, all efforting just keeps the game going.

**Mind is like a bicycle — it must keep moving or it will fall down. It goes on creating struggle, searching,survival,desire. It creates movement, striving, change, because otherwise it simply disappears, it falls down. <font color=red>Mind is the struggle itself</font>. Without the struggle there’s no mind either.**

The mind as controller, as chooser, as decider, as the “I” just disappears. It was an illusion all along, it never existed except as the struggle. But the computing mechanism is still there, and it can be used as a tool just as a hammer is picked up and used when needed. The capability to compute is still there, but the computer is silent unless called upon.

If an awakened person crosses a street the computer-brain will figure out the right time to cross. But the mind, the“separate” person is vanished. That which struggled to control,that which thought of itself as the “I” is gone because it was only the struggle itself. Now the Existence, the Self crosses the street. The guests — thoughts, tapes, the mind — took over the house while the host was away, but now the host has returned.

The master does not need to effort. After all, the river flows by itself. Indeed, at the deepest level we are the river. <font color=red>We’ve already arrived. What are we struggling about?</font>




## Chapter Twenty-six
Freedom is a deep seeing that this is it. This is the way it is. This is the way it turned out. Is is is... **Things are the way they are**. And things are not the way they are not. Right now,nothing can be any different than the way it is. **In the next moment it may be different, but right now it can’t be any different**. And <font color=red>all there ever is is right now</font>. **The future never arrives, because it’s always just right now.**

This is it, this is the way the river is flowing. To accept it is to enjoy it. But the acceptance is not a decision, it’s rather a deep awareness that this is the way it is. Love and acceptance are carried within awareness as a seed.

**Awakening is seeing that things are never going to be any different than the way they are... until they are.** It is seeing that the river is going to flow this way forever... unless it flows some other way. The clouds will go north until they don't.The sun will rise unless it doesn’t. All attempts to change or find the answer simply fall away as we become aware of this. At the deepest level, all there ever is to do is to notice the way it is right now, to be fully conscious of it. Then we’re **in deep harmony with the way things are**. We’re in deep harmony with Existence.

To use a different terminology, all there ever is to do is to get off our positions. We get on a position, get off it, on another position, off it, on it, off it — forever. It’s not as if we get off all our positions *once and for all*. That would be like trying to eat breakfast once and for all.

```
once and for all 彻底地 ; 一劳永逸地

No, the tapes will always be running... until they don't. And what there is to do when they come up is to <font color=red>notice them,be aware of them as what they are</font>. Then they flatten, they disappear. **We don’t do anything with them. We don’t ignore them, reject them or try to change them. We simply notice them... like leaves on the river.**

The ground from which we perceive things transforms. Before, the ground was unawareness and sometimes we were aware. After, the ground is awareness and sometimes we’re unaware. But the circumstances of our life look the same — the same tapes still run, and sometimes we’re aware of them and sometimes not.. .just as before. Everything is the same.

Everything is the same, but it is being perceived in a new way. If life is a bowl of cherries, then the cherries — the circumstances of our life — have not changed, but the bowl itself has changed.

And what is that difference? Before, the bowl — the context in which everything is held — was that certain things needed to be achieved or changed. After, the ground is that this is the way it is, and that <font color=red>all there ever is to do is to be aware of the way it is</font>. Since that is not a doingness, it’s doing nothing. But again, doing nothing doesn’t necessarily look like inactivity; it looks like just doing what we do.

**Just doing what we do, following our inner guidance,without performing our actions as means to an end. Then each action can become a blissful end-in-itself.**

```
致吾心之良知
```

It is as if we’ve been trying all our life to liberate ourself from a room in which we’re trapped. And we’ve been pushing ceaselessly against the door, trying to get out, and it hasn’t budged. Our efforts in pushing against the door — the movements of the mind — never flag even for a moment, but it’s all to no avail. The door just won’t open. Awakening is seeing that the door opens inwards, and that pushing against the door is what has been preventing it from opening.

Or to put it another way, awakening is seeing that the door won’t open because it’s the wrong door — so why push against it? But it’s worse than that. Awakening is seeing that it’s impossible to ever find the right door, and then, seeing that there are no doors at all, just solid walls. And then seeing that not only are there no doors, there are no walls either; infact, there is no room!

It’s seeing that we’re already out of the room, because no room is there. The room was an illusion created by the mind so that it would have something to do — to try to get out. But how can we get out of a room when we’re already out? <font color=red>This is mind, struggling to get to a place where it already is, striving to achieve a result that’s already achieved</font>.




## Chapter Twenty-seven
It’s been said that awakening is finding out that there’s no such thing as awakening. The mind sets up awakening or cosmic consciousness or whatever as another goal, the greatest goal. In Osho’s great metaphor, mind thinks that freedom is the top rung of a ladder somewhere. Mind is a compulsive ladder-climber; it carries its ladder around with it and when it finds a good spot it sets it down and starts climbing again. Of course, others need to be elbowed out of the way. And there’s no end to the rungs — mind can always create more.

**But awakening is not at the top of some ladder, some hierarchy. It’s getting down off all the ladders forever.** More accurately, it’s seeing that the ladders are a creation of the mind, that there are no ladders. So there’s no need to get to the top of them, and no need to get off them either.

<font color=red>We’re already off — as soon as we see that we are</font>. As soon as we see that we’re off the ladders, we see that we have always been off them because there are no ladders. In the instant of awakening, we see that we’ve always been awakened because there’s no awakening to achieve. Awakening is seeing that nothing whatever needs to be achieved, including of course awakening itself. It just happens when it does.

We’ve been dreaming, and in the dream creating walls,obstacles, barriers, as well as power and money, achievements and pleasures. We’ve gone quite far away in the dream, to a distant city, and finally in the dream we begin to realize that we are very far away indeed from home.

Then it seems as if it will be very arduous to get back.We begin using various devices.. .workshops, metaphysics,concentrations, gurus. ..but the journey back seems endless.We’re too far away, it seems.. .how to get back?

But the problem is the dreaming itself. The problem is that we’re still in a dream. In fact, **who we really are is already herenow, we have only to awaken to it**. It only seems as if we are far away — **we have only to awaken and we’re back home instantly**.

All spiritual methods are simply to change the nature of our dream so that we can awaken from it. Until we awaken,methods and devices are necessary to tamper with the dream.. .make it more pleasant, less pleasant, more peaceful,more anxious, whatever.. .until we awaken. Then the dreaming is ended and the devices are too. So **a master uses different devices with different people. It depends on what they see in the dream**, how they sense that someone’s dream needs to be disturbed.

The great teachings stress that awakening happens in an instant. For no preparation needs to be made. It’s not a journey, therefore nothing needs to be done. There is no question of changing the circumstances of one’s life first, or of changing one’s programming. Journeys and preparations and changes all take time; they are all of the mind, part of the dream. No, one simply awakens; it is instantaneous. We just see, no preparation is needed. And in that seeing the concept of awakening itself is discarded. It too was simply a device. **Infact, the mind cannot be enlightened. The mind is actually an illusion; with what will we enlighten it?**




## Chapter Twenty-eight
<font color=red>If awakening happens in an instant, why doesn’t it happen to us right now, this instant? </font>Because we — the mind —don’t want it to. We want to continue to cling to our goals, our attitudes, our beliefs, our patterns and payoffs. We want to stay in movement. We don’t want to be awakened this instant because we would have to let go of the idea that we can control, choose, decide, make things different or better. We would have to let go of who we think we are and what we think we are doing. We would have to let go of “you” and “I,” and we’re not ready. The dream is familiar, and the problems are old friends — we’re not ready.

So, paradoxically, time is needed. There is actually no need for it, but we cause it to be needed. Now time is needed for awareness to develop. It’s not a preparation, for no changes are necessary. Rather, we’ll continue to cling, but awareness will flower in us by and by.. .and then one day it will happen.Our awareness will have become strong enough so that suddenly we see through all our efforts to remain occupied. We see that awareness is all that is ever needed or possible, and that our efforts to achieve a result are what have been causing the delay.

This is satori, awakening. But it’s not the final, ultimate liberation. It is not the case that after satori we will never run a tape again, never desire again, never again project our version of reality onto reality. Those things will still happen, we can expect them. But the ground has shifted. Now <font color=red>when those things happen we watch them, observe them</font>. ..except when we don’t.

And we’ve seen that ultimately this witnessing is all that can ever be done, and that it’s not a doing. So nothing is being done, nothing is being changed, everything is the same. Yet things begin happening around us. <font color=red>As awareness increases,reality changes for us</font>. We begin living in a different world,even though it’s the same world. Problems clear up or are nolonger experienced as problems, because all problems at bottom are just due to insufficient consciousness.

As we continue to **watch the mind**, awareness deepens. And as the awareness deepens, more and more tapes lose energy, lose force, lose reality. More and more of them become transparent and then disappear. It’s not that we’re trying to make them disappear. There’s an acceptance of them, we’re perfectly willing to have them there. In that very acceptance,though, they start disappearing of their own accord. And as they start disappearing a great silence increasingly descends on us. We become more and more still within.

```
watch the mind
```

And then one day the final, the ultimate happens. The tapes are all gone, they are simply there no more. And we’re there no more either. All desires, all goals, all clingings, all programs are absent, extinguished. There is no past and no future anymore, there is only the moment. <font color=red>**The ego’s smoky candle flame has gone out, but now the sun lights up the sky.We are dead, we are gone, but now God is alIive.**</font> While we were, God was not. Now that we are not, God is. Existence Itself now dances through the form where we used to be. The inner Melody just moves through us.

<font color=red>This is nirvana, the final enlightenment.</font> And “nirvana”is such a beautiful word, for it means “no burning.” There’s nolonger the burning of desire, of striving and clutching. And in the absence of that, in that utter emptiness there’s a quiet bliss that’s beyond happiness, beyond excitement, beyond the thrill of any kind of experience. The bliss of Existence Itself.
Now It moves, It controls.
As Jesus said: “Thy will be done.”



# Silence

## Chapter Twenty-nine
Clouds float across the sky. They’re not trying to go anywhere. They’re not trying to accomplish anything. They are not choosing where to go. They are just drifting, letting the Existence carry them along. There is no decision-making,no trying, no struggle. There is a let-go, but **not even a let-go,for there is no controller to let go**. There’s simply peace. There is what is.

All of Existence is like this. There is no purpose to it,no meaning, no goal. As Osho said, <font color=red>meaning and purpose are constructions of the mind which it imposes on Existence</font>. The mind thinks that Existence has to get somewhere, that there has to be some purpose to it all, that someday some far-flung omega-point will be reached and that was the purpose. But then what is the purpose of the omega-point? <font color=red>Purpose is always an infinite regression, it always depends on something else. What is right now is never enough.</font>

```
far-flung 遥远的；分布广的；广泛的；
omega-point 奥米茄点，一切发展与进化的终点；
```

<font color=red>**The purpose of Existence is just to be here right now,being what It is. It is totally sufficient in Itself at each instant.It has no purpose except Itself. It has no reason except Itself. The rose is not trying to be something else; it is in bliss to be what it is this moment**.</font>

Clouds, rivers, trees, life itself — all of Existence is in a deep ecstasy. All except us humans. We humans are in secret misery because our mind can't accept this moment; we must try to be somewhere else. We must try to control. We must make decisions. The mind is always serious — there are things to be done. Even when we let go, even when we laugh its only on the surface. Deep down the mind is still serious.

Existence, on the other hand, is playing. It is having fun with no goal. Yes, there is death. There is pain. But death is an integral part of life, its absolutely necessary to life. <font color=red>Life and death are not opposed to each other, they are two faces of the same thing</font>. Death clears out the rigidity, the calcification, the stuckness, the willfulness, the dead unbending ness and thus makes life possible.

```
unbending ness 不屈不挠
```

Life is flexibility, its suppleness, its the ability to adjust to change, to bend with the wind. A tree begins as a flexible sapling and ends as dried-out stiffness. **Without death there would be no life, for there could be no change, no room for life.** All would come to a standstill. Death/life are inseparable;they’re the same phenomenon.

<font color=red>Similarly, pleasure is impossible without pain. They’re inseparable; they’re also one phenomenon. The mind creates them, separates them, then tries to cling to the one and avoid the other. **Mind can’t accept the totality; that’s why it misses.**When we’re feeling pleasure, pain is taking a rest. It’s gathering energy, it will soon come to the fore. When we’re feeling pain, pleasure is taking a rest and gathering energy; soon it will come.</font>

When the pendulum swings to one side it must then swing to the other, but it remains the same pendulum. Beauty is impossible without ugliness. Good is impossible without evil. Happiness and sadness depend on each other. Love and hate include each other. <font color=red>Dualities come into existence at the same time</font>. Mind creates them. **Existence is simply what it is.Mind creates polarities and interpretations about it.**

```
有无相生
polarities n.
(两种倾向、意见等的)截然对立，两极化;极性(两极并存的状态) polarity的复数
```

Existence in its suchness is perfect as it is. Which is more perfect, ice or water? **All is equal, nothing is better than anything else. Nothing is more important than anything else.** Nothing is needed for all to be complete. Which is better, a long blade of grass or a short blade? Both are perfect. The Existence is perfect, and goes from perfection to perfection.This looks illogical. If reality is going to be perfect, how can it already be perfect? This makes no sense to the mind, for the mind is a perfectionist — always wanting to achieve perfection. But how can it achieve perfection when Existence is already perfect? It’s an absurd task.

```
All is equal ?
```

But what about disease, poverty, evil? What exists is what exists, only the mind labels certain parts of it as “bad.”Good and bad depend upon our point of view. If we see a cat kill a mouse, that is not evil to us; that’s just nature. But to the brother of the mouse it is evil. What threatens our survival or the survival of that which we identify with is “bad” to us; what assists our survival we then call “good.” **To see good and bad requires a position, a point of view, an identity.** <font color=red>When there is no identity and no position there is no bad, and no good either. Then all simply is what it is</font>.

**There is no way to foresee the ultimate consequences of anything. That which we call bad may lead to good. That which we label good may lead to bad**. Certain monastic orders did many good deeds and also administered the Inquisition;was the founding of the orders good or bad? Drug pushing in Harlem led to capital formation for black businesses. Was this good or bad? The mind is a limited instrument and cannot see more than very limited consequences.

```
祸兮福之所倚，福兮祸之所伏。
monastic orders 修道会
cannot see more than 只能看到
```

Finally, Existence appears to be a multiplicity on the surface, but that is just appearance, that is the projections and discriminations of mind. Beneath the apparent multiplicity created by the mind, we find oneness.. .the One. Existence is non-dual. Existence is eternal and changeless and yet appears to change, **just as the sky has light and darkness and snow and rain, yet remains itself unaffected by any of it.** The One is not poor, not rich, neither diseased nor healthy, neither good nor bad — and that is who we really are, that is all there is.

The One has no attributes and yet has all attributes — It has all the forms of the world. This is the divine dance, the divine play. Beneath each form is the One, is Existence itself,and It is bliss. Existence does not suffer. Except for humans,the forms of Existence can feel pain but not suffering. Only we suffer, because <font color=red>only we compare and desire and feel ourselves to be separate</font>. Only we are attached to things being a certain way — and that’s the only cause of suffering. It isn’t logical, but it can be seen.




## Chapter Thirty
To say that Existence is One is the same as saying that Existence is everything, **for if it is One it leaves nothing out**.If something were left out then Existence would no longer be non-dual, it would no longer be One.

Similarly, to say that Existence is One is the same as saying that It is emptiness, nothingness, for one can only be understood in contrast to two; **if Existence is One then there’s nothing to contrast it with, and so it is the same as saying it’s nothing.**

```
Existence = One = Nothing
因为One包含所有，所以没有任何东西可以拿来和One比较，因为无法被比较，所以无法被分辨，所以One什么也不是。
```

The ocean is one, but to a fish it’s the very quality of existence. There is no way to get outside of it, no way to contrast it with anything else, so to a fish the ocean is nothing, it doesn't exist. If a pencil is expanded until it is everything it vanishes, it becomes nothing. Not only is the One everything,the totality — It is also nothing, emptiness, the Void.

This description can also apply to the person who has reached <font color=red>nirvana, final awakening</font>. **They are everything, they are nothing, they are one.** They’re one because they’re unified,they’re in harmony. There’s no longer any distinction between the conscious and unconscious mind, because everything is conscious.

```
nirvana = final awakening
```

Such a person is **no longer a cacophony of successive mind-states** — anger replaced by hope frustration replaced by gratification, etc. Instead, they are in peace and serenity; they are in a deep harmony with All. There are nolonger conflicting elements — love competing with hate, greed competing with fear, happiness competing with grief. Now all of it is included, all is transcended. They are whole, complete,serene. They are One.

Such a person is also everything, the Totality, because there are no longer any boundaries. Trees merge into the sky merge into clouds merge into others. **Not that they don’t use labels and concepts when appropriate, but they <font color=red>just play with them as utensils, devices</font>. They <font color=red>no longer see the labels and concepts as reality</font>. Reality for them is All, is One.**

```
一切皆是”物“，天地不仁，以万物为刍狗；圣人不仁，以百姓为刍狗。
```

There’s no longer any experiential separation between such a person and someone else. When she helps her neighbor there is no thought of “help,” when she loves her neighbor there is no thought of “love.” The neighbor is her, she is her neighbor. It is simply the left hand washing the right.

She is also nothing, for she is empty. She is empty of desires, attitudes, models, concepts, positions, attachments,goals, judgments, rigidities. She is empty of tapes, empty of programming. **She can use such things when appropriate, but otherwise <font color=red>there is silence within; they do not run her</font>.** For instance, if she talks about what has happened to her she will use concepts and positions to do so, but she won’t take them seriously. They won’t be “truth” to her, they won’t be “reality.”She’ll just play with them.

And if she talks again tomorrow she’ll probably contradict what she said today, and deliberately so. For the listening mind will try to box up what she says, to position it, to make it into the “truth.” So the awakened person will break up tomorrow the concepts she put together today.

For she knows that what she is talking about can’t be contained anyway. What she is really doing is using words to point to something beyond words, she is using structures to allude to something beyond structures. She’s hinting, she’s using metaphor, she’s playing with boxes and structures but doesn’t take them seriously. She’s not attached to them. Her real message is the silence between the words, the emptiness beneath the structures. She uses words to seduce people into silence.

She’s empty of goals. Yet if she goes to the supermarket to buy apples it will appear that she’s set up a goal to that effect. But that’s only the appearance. It is all equal to her. If her car has a flat tire on the way, that is just as good as the apples to her. She has no preference. She was just playing with the apples and the supermarket, it was just a dance.

If now the dance moves this way instead of that way, it is all the same to her. It is beautiful this way too. Whatsoever happens is beautiful to her, she’ll celebrate it. For she is **silent inside**. **She can play with goals, models, concepts, attitudes when the moment arises, but she doesn’t cling to them — and they don’t come unless she asks them.** They do not run her because they don’t come uninvited. Besides, she’s not there,there is nobody to run.

She is not there <font color=red>because who she was has died</font>. Who she thought she was was her beliefs, attitudes, thoughts, goals,emotions, sensations, desires, status — all of her positions, all the limited things that she clung to. She thought she was her programming. Now all that is dead.

It’s not that the computing machinery is not there anymore. It is there, but it computes now only when called upon.It doesn’t manufacture stories and behaviors of its own accord anymore. And it’s not that the tapes are erased. They are there in storage — she can remember them if she wants to — but now **they are memories only**. There is no identification with them. They have no reality, no force, no energy. They don’t come up of their own accord, in response to stimuli. They come up only if called upon. As they used to be, they no longer exist.

Because the tapes don’t exist anymore, she doesn’t exist anymore either. Because who she used to be was just the tapes and programs, including ones that she existed separately, that she was choosing, that she knew what was true.

Now she is gone and there is no-mind, emptiness. Now the Divine is there, the Existence is there, the Ocean is there. Because she is gone, God is at home. Now there is no more controller, no more chooser. There never was; there were only tapes with the concept of a controller, a decider. When the controller, the chooser disappeared she disappeared too. Now Existence chooses. Now the Mystery is the controller.




## Chapter Thirty-one
Who is beating our heart right now? If we are, then let’s will it to stop beating. Who is filtering our blood? If we are,then let’s will it to stop for a few moments. In truth, Existence caused us to be born, Existence is beating our heart, Existence is breathing us. It is moving the sun and stars, it is moving the electron around the nucleus, it’s blowing the wind and raining the rain.

It’s doing all of it — all of it absolutely. Why, then, do we persist in believing that we must fend for ourself, that we must look out for #1? <font color=red>Existence is taking care of our heart; will it not take care of us?</font> Our life is no more than a dewdrop on a leaf, slowly falling off — why all this fighting, ambition, struggling, seeking? We are a drop of rain evaporating in the sun. Let’s enjoy it! Can we see our real situation?

Let’s look within and let a deep trust arise. Let’s let ourself be borne on the back of Existence. Let’s let the river carry us. In truth, It’s carrying us anyway. Why struggle?

```
大块载我
```

But this is not enough for the mind. The mind finds it difficult to trust. The mind asks, “But what if I die? What if I don’t get enough to eat? What if I don’t get enough money? What if I don’t get the right partner?” And so on.

<font color=red>Mind’s questions presuppose certain preferences</font>. But the awakened person has no more preferences. If death comes,good; she’ll celebrate it. If hunger comes, good; she’ll celebrate it. If illness comes, good; she’ll celebrate it. If joy comes, good;she’ll celebrate it. If the wind blows through the trees, good;she’ll celebrate it. **Whatsoever it is, she will celebrate it, she will be grateful for it.** And in truth, the river is going to flow wherever It flows anyway. Why not celebrate the way It is,whatever It is?

```
Whatsoever it is, she will celebrate it, she will be grateful for it. 
???
```

There is a true story of the Sufi master Bayazid and his disciples who came to a town at night. It was cold and raining and they were hungry, but the townspeople would not let them in. So they went to an adjacent hill, and there Bayazid praised God for his many blessings. One of his disciples said,“Now this is too much, you have gone too far. We are hungry,cold, wet tonight — and you’re praising God?” Bayazid replied,“I must praise Him, for He fulfills my needs so beautifully. Tonight I need to be hungry. Tonight I need to be cold and in poverty. Tonight I need to be wet and shivering. Otherwise,why should He give them to me? He takes care of my needs so perfectly.”

This is the trusting being. There’s a let-go, there is **no struggle anymore**. <font color=red>In his heart there is acceptance and joy and a deep gratitude for All that is</font>. His gratitude and acceptance are so great that he cannot contain them; they overflow in a profound bliss that is independent of circumstances.

Just to see the sky is too great a gift for him, it overflows into bliss. Just to see a tree blow in the wind or hear the crickets cry is the fulfillment of his being. To eat his dinner or to look into the eyes of another is the meaning of his existence. It is totally complete, moment-by-moment. Nothing is lacking. All is perfect. Simply that things be what they are, that is all that he asks.

Actually, it is not even accurate to say that he is trusting or accepting, for that implies a decision about it. Accurately,he doesn’t trust, he doesn’t accept, for there’s nobody there.There is no one to be trusting or accepting. Simply, there is trust, there is acceptance. There is gratitude, celebration, bliss. They’re simply there.

Such a person sees that there is nothing to do and that nothing is needed, so he doesn’t do anything. To the mind this sounds as if he lays down and goes to sleep, but in fact it just means that he does what he does. The inner Melody moves by Itself. The Voice moves through that hollow flute.




## Chapter Thirty-two
Doing nothing does not have a particular form to it; it doesn't look a certain way. It is not a form or doingness, but **a state of mind. More accurately, a state of no-mind, a state of absence.**

```
a state !
```

When a bird sings it isn’t thinking about how it must sing today and it doesn’t have a goal about finishing its song. It has no purpose in mind, it is not trying to accomplish anything. It’s simply singing out of its exuberance, there is no goal or meaning about it. It’s doing nothing. The awakened person is the same. He “does nothing” because he is not attached to any goal; **his mind is silent, absent**.

From that silence he spontaneously does each moment whatever will be most harmonious and appropriate. He does not think about it, there’s no decision. He simply does what he does; whatever happens, happens. There is no doingness,there is no effort anymore. All effort is gone. All is spontaneous, effortless, harmonious, compassionate. Yet to some-one’s mind it may not look that way.

He may strike a devotee, as many Zen masters did. To the mind this looks cruel. But it may be the precise action that will awaken that devotee in that moment, in that situation. It may be the greatest compassion. There is no way to judge it,Existence itself is acting. He may found a hospital, or throw a party. He may teach people how to dance, or sit silently. He may comfort a weeping person. Or he may not;he may want that person to fully experience the grief. There is no way to tell what he will do, or what he should do.

The mind takes the concept of awakening and decides what it would look like, what an awakened master would do and say and act like. And it is like a caterpillar trying to decide how a butterfly should act. There is no way for it to know, for it can only think in caterpillar terms.

Awakening has no form, no structure; it doesn't look a particular way. There are people who think that an awakened being should look always loving or always serene or whatever their model is. But a master may be stern or gentle, talkative or silent, playful or penetrating, depending on the moment. **He uses forms, they do not use him**. He plays with whatever form is most appropriate to the moment.

The awakened being has no doctrines, no moral code,no set of rules. None are needed. Moral codes are attempts to curb the innate violence and greed of the mind. They are necessary restrictions imposed from the outside since the inside spirit is lacking. A master is absolutely moral, but **the ethics is flowing from the inside out and no set of rules can contain it**. His morality is a function of the moment; it’s a spontaneous,harmonious response. He is not thinking in terms of being“moral” or “good.” He simply responds in the appropriate way. He is **just natural, flexible**.

```
moral code 道德准则
```

All other so-called moralities are suppressions of the mind’s greed and violence, they are a using of force against force. With the mind in control they are sometimes necessary,but they’re not natural.

**Humans have become the most unnatural animal, infact the only unnatural animal.** We’re addicted to force since we want to change things and we feel it is very important that they be changed. We don’t see that all problems reside within our own mind, are creations of our mind. We don’t see that **using force to accomplish our ends is like trying to pry open a flower by force**. Nothing is accomplished except destroying the flower.

Existence is doing it all. Existence opens up millions of flowers everyday, no force is needed. No help at all is needed. What can we do? We can just stay out of the way and let the river flow. It will take care of everything. It already is taking care of everything, we just don’t see it. When we drop our struggling and our models of how it should be, we find that It’s already carrying us and always has been.

We humans have surrounded ourselves with dogmas,rules, regulations. We create our own prison with our mind,and then cling to our bars because they are familiar to us, they are a known item. **Mind feels comfortable with the known,threatened by the unknown because mind cannot exist in the unknown.** The unknown is infinite, wild, unpredictable; it is the very fabric of Existence itself. So even though we may be in misery in our prison, we cling to our dogmas and our rules and rituals.

They serve the purpose of reducing the unlimited to the limited. They reduce the unknowable to the knowable. They are familiar, a comfortable misery. Then we try to escape this prison by improving things, including improving our rules and dogmas. This is like decorating our cell with jewels,replacing the iron bars with gold ones. Were still in prison.

**The person of wisdom**, on the other hand, is free. One of the names for awakening is moksha , liberation. She's willing to go wherever life leads her. She knows nothing, and knows that she knows nothing. She has no rules, no guidelines, no security. She plunges into the unknown moment-by-moment. She is surrendered to Existence, she trusts it totally. She is grateful just to be alIive, just to breathe. If life gives her bitter fruit to eat, she is grateful for it. If life gives her sweet fruit,she's grateful for it. It's all the same, there's no sweet or bitter.She is simply aware; she watches.

This awareness is the key. If her body-mind cries or becomes sad, she's not identified with it. She’s a witness to it,she watches this beautiful flower of sadness. She doesn't try to stop it or push it away or distract herself. She watches it just as she would watch the clouds in the sky or the ripples on a lake. The sadness has its own beauty.

**There's no difference for her between inner phenomena and outer phenomena, between emotions passing and clouds passing; she watches both. They are the same — simply waves on the surface of Existence. As she watches the sadness, by and by it disappears like a cloud passing to the horizon. It was beautiful but she doesn't cling to it.**

Now she witnesses whatever is next. It might sound as if she’s indifferent, but she’s not — she’s just detached. To be indifferent is to have little or no interest in life. Either life has beaten down such a person and they’ve become filled with hopelessness, or they’ve become jaded and cynical about life and it appears dull and tedious.

The person of freedom is not indifferent at all. He is very alIive to life. He is filled with it moment-to-moment,whatsoever it is; he is spontaneous. But he’s detached because he **does not cling to any particular part of life**. He lets each moment go to make way for whatever is in the next moment. He is open, receptive, flexible... but not indifferent in the least.He watches all, accepts all, but clings to nothing, identifies with nothing.

He is **like an empty mirror**. Whatsoever stands in front of the mirror is reflected faithfully. The mirror does not ask whether you are beautiful or ugly, male or female, friendly or hostile, healthy or sick, rich or poor, young or old, powerful or helpless. The mirror doesn’t try to avoid you, it doesn’t ask you to stand in front of it. It has neither a version nor desire.

It simply reflects you faithfully when you are in front of it. It is filled with you. But it does not identify with you, it does not feel that its survival depends on you. It is not worried about survival at all. **When you leave the mirror does not cling, it lets you go. It does not ask you to stay, it does not cling even for a moment.**

The person of wisdom is like this. His consciousness is empty, silent. **If something comes into his consciousness he accepts it, loves it, is grateful for it, but doesn’t cling to it.** Even to say that he does these things is inaccurate, for he is not there. Rather, the acceptance, the love, the gratitude is simply there.

Even to say that they are there is inaccurate, for there is no concept that they are there. **There is just a perfect reflection of what is there, an unstained consciousness of what is there, a choiceless mirror-like awareness of what is there —and this is the acceptance and love.**





## Chapter Thirty-three
Love is often thought of as something we do. But have you ever tried to love? It feels shallow, false. <font color=red>Whenever we are trying to be something, it means we're not that thing</font>. Otherwise, what’s the point of trying? If we’re trying to be pregnant,we’re not. If we’re trying to be loving, we’re not loving. <font color=red>The very effort of trying means it is not genuine, it is not natural.</font> Love isn’t a trying, it’s not an attitude. It is not an activity. It’s not a shining glow in the eyes, and it’s not a melting feeling. And it’s not an intoxication with someone or something.

Love isn’t a feeling or a point of view or a doingness. It has no form to it, it doesn’t look a particular way. The mind doesn’t love, for love is possible only when there aren’t any attachments or objectives, when the moment alone is everything. It is the Self that loves.

Love isn’t something that has to be achieved, not something that has to be put into place. It is always there. Always it is there, but it’s obscured by mind just as clouds obscure the sun. Let the mind fall away through awareness, and suddenly love is there, it is already there. It has always been there. It is the bottomline. We can’t do it. Yet become still inside and it is already present. **When mind is absent, love is present**.

Since love is at the level of the Self, it has no form to it. Its like a fragrance emanating from a flower. It is there; we may partake or not, as we wish. Its like a gentle rain which waters good crops and bad crops alike. It has no preferences,it makes no choices.

It is unconditional, it asks for nothing in return. On the contrary, its an overflowing, it has too much already. It is like rain clouds pregnant with water; theres a gratitude that the thirsty earth is willing to receive the rain. It is like an orange blossom heavy with nectar; it is grateful when the bee takes some. Love asks for nothing. What could it ask for? It is already full, it is overflowing.

Love doesn't try to possess, for it doesn't need anything. It allows perfect freedom, for nothing is needed in return. **If something is needed** — some commitment, some expression of gratitude — **then it's not love.** **Love and freedom are not separable; they're two wings of the same bird**. Possessiveness is always of the mind; it is about being unfilled, about lacking something. Love is full, it doesn’t cling. It will not try to hold anyone. It accepts whatever is, each moment. It's not attached,it has no preferences. Like the sun, it shines on all things.

To love, the quality of all relationships is the same. The quantity may differ — more time may be spent with some than with others — but the quality is identical. The mind rebels at this, for it always wants to be special and unique and to focus on the special and unique. **But to love, each person has the same essence; indeed, everything in Existence has the same essence.**

True love is non-directional, therefore. It’s not directed towards particular persons or things; it has no address on it. It is open to everyone and everything.

Love is easily misunderstood by the mind. For instance,the mind may decide that it is very loving now and that its love is unconditional. This has nothing to do with love, for **real love is unconscious of itself and has nothing to do with decisions or self-image**.

Alternatively, mind may interpret having no preferences as some formula about sexual promiscuity or celibacy. This conceives of love as an activity or a denial, and it’s neither one. **Romance, sex, renunciation are all drugs, intoxicants; they are a doingness and we come down from them.** We don’t come down from love because it is not an up.

<font color=red>Love is not hot as passion is. Neither is it cold. It is just in the middle — a quiet, subtle, warm fragrance which can’t be practiced or implemented, but which expresses spontaneously when the mind is no longer there.</font>




## Chapter Thirty-four
Acceptance is also easily misconceived by the mind. “So if all things are perfect then I might as well hurt or deceive others — what difference does it make?” **Such an attitude sees acceptance *or its lack* as a decision. But <font color=red>acceptance just arises on its own when the mind is silent</font>**. So it has nothing to do with any conclusion by the mind that hurting or deceiving others is okay. Such a decision would merely be another tape of the mind, more of its survival programming.

This does not mean to stop doing what we do. That would just be a suppression, a violence; the thwarted energy will not go away but will distort us, it will show up in some other form.

If we eat meat, we might continue to do so but now eat meat with awareness. If we deceive others, we might continue to do so but observe ourselves as we do it. Let’s watch. Let’s observe. If we’re a thief let’s add awareness to our thievery —it will fall from us, for it’s not possible to steal consciously. **Let’s not try to change ourselves or blame ourselves, because all that is the usual game. Trying to change ourselves hasn’t worked and won’t work at the deepest level. Yet in becoming aware, certain things fall away from us.**

If we force ourselves to give something up then the desire will still be there, just suppressed. But as we become aware, certain things just fall away. There is no effort, no struggle involved. Those things that drop away are “sins.” Those that don’t are “virtues.” **It’s a natural process**.

```
force and suppressed，是一种低阶手段，高阶手段都是自然的。
```

Ultimately, the attempt to fight or suppress “sin” or the undesirable is an attempt to fight with darkness. But at the deepest level, as Osho points out, darkness does not exist — it’s just an absence of light. How then can we defeat it? <font color=red>How can we defeat something that fundamentally is an absence?</font>

The mind says in effect, “I must get rid of this darkness first before I can turn on the light.” Can we see what the mind is doing? <font color=red>We don’t need to bother about the darkness in our life or in the lives of others, it’s a futile struggle. Far more effective is to turn on a light.</font>

When the light is turned on, darkness vanishes. There is no need to fight with it; no effort is needed. A room can be dark for many years, yet it still takes only a moment to turn on the light and then the darkness is gone.

**Fighting sin is like fighting an enemy in a dream. We don’t need to defeat him; we can just wake up.** If we’re being harmed by others, or if we’re the one doing the harming, or if we’re harming ourself, we can put our focus and energy on turning on a light in the situation.

<font color=red>What is that light?</font> It **can be finding a positive goal that all can put their energy toward.** It **can be a love warm enough to dissolve barriers and hatreds**. It **can be looking within to see how our own stories are perpetuating our separateness.**

In doing this, any type of rigidity that we try to impose on ourself or life is again a suppression, a form of violence. <font color=red>Life is flexibility, openness, a plunge into the unknown each moment.</font> How can this occur if we're frozen into a structure? **A slavish devotion to rules or discipline can make us dead inside**. Even awareness can be made into a discipline if it is approached rigidly; then it is not awareness because it has the smell of effort, of tension. **The whole point is to become less and less tense inside, more and more open and relaxed.**

```
对任何规则任何教条奴隶般的忠诚将会使我们原本拥有的内在的灵活性死亡。
```

Like anything else, rules and disciplines can be useful as devices. They can alter the dream so that the dreamer may begin to rouse from his slumbers. But **whatever we might use as a device, lets relax into it, ease into it, flow with it.**

<font color=red>Lets let everything lead us to increased relaxation, for awakening is simply the ultimate relaxation</font>.**If we decide to sit quietly from six to seven every morning, for instance, lets approach it as a relaxation; lets let it be a deep easiness. **If we approach it as a heavy, serious duty we’ll destroy the whole value of it.**

```
awakening is simply the ultimate relaxation.
```

<font color=red>If we use discipline on ourself, lets use it with some awareness. Lets watch ourself as we use it; then something will begin to awaken within us.</font> At first it will be very fragile. Thus as awareness first develops, we may want to maintain our discipline just as you would keep a wire fence around a small sapling to protect it. But once the dreamer is fully awake, all rules and disciplines fall away; they’re just irrelevant now. An awakened being may look disciplined because of a daily routine or rhythm, but that’s just the appearance.

The routine of an awakened person is not a discipline because it’s not something imposed. Rather, it’s a rhythm that has **arisen naturally, spontaneously, by itself**. The Melody is moving unimpeded now in that vessel. The light is on.




## Chapter Thirty-five
Just be natural, the Taoist master Chuang Tzu says.

“When the shoe fits, the foot is forgotten.” He is saying that only when there is struggle or discomfort do we become aware of something. **This is the situation of the mind — continually in a struggle, in a discomfort.** Let’s see the point: How else can it maintain itself? It is the struggle, the discomfort. It has no existence other than that. If we’re just natural, if we’re ordinary, if we’re balanced, there is no place for the mind to stand. It must fall.

To be natural means to be balanced, it means to be in the middle. This is Buddha’s middle way. Mind always wants to go to extremes, so it can keep moving. First we eat too much, then we starve ourself. Or we work very competitively,and then we go to the other side and relax very competitively. Or first we’re a playboy, then we get sick of that and want to become a saint. **The mind tends to move to extremes, it often doesn’t know where or when to stop. This keeps the mind alIive, because by moving to extremes it keeps moving.**

The master is a contrast to that. She’s balanced, like a tight rope walker. She leans neither to the left nor the right;but stays balanced over the center, not going to extremes.

She has a great sense of appropriateness. She’s just easy,ordinary. <font color=red>To be ordinary is a rare quality, for the mind is always trying to be extraordinary.</font> It wants to distinguish itself,it wants to stand out from the crowd. Even humility can serve this purpose — the mind will try to be the most humble. This effort to be unique keeps the mind alIive, but it is absolutely absurd. The universe is so vast. **We’re like *a grain of sand* on the beach trying to stand out from the other grains. Pretty absurd.**

The master knows better; she has seen through such nonsense. She’s natural, she’s easy, she’s light. “**Easy is right**,”says Chuang Tzu. Easy in the beginning, easy in the middle,easy in the end. **The master is effortless, non-serious, playful.** She knows there is nothing to do, so everything she does is“nothing special.”

She just does what she’s doing — without compulsion,without attachment. It’s a good test: <font color=red>Does what we’re doing feel aligned *deep down*, regardless of what’s happening on the surface? If not, the message may be that we’re fighting the river somehow.</font> The mind can make a tension even out of easiness by making a rule out of it. “Be easy.” This won't work. So how do we become easy?

```
deep down 在内心深处，在心底（知道）
```

Actually, mind cannot ever really be easy and relaxed because it’s always trying to change or control things. Just look: The Existence is vast, infinite, incomprehensible — and we are going to change it? **We know better than God how things should go?** We make war on Reality — especially in our mind — and then wonder why life seems so difficult.

Since the mind finds it difficult to relax, one device is to use the mind against the mind, to use the mind to go further into doingness. By pushing the pendulum to an extreme —heavy physical exertion, *primal therapy*, sustained dancing,etc. — the pendulum automatically swings back to the otherside and a silence ensues. In that silence, awareness can arise.

```
primal therapy 原始疗法
```

Awareness is the true road to easiness. All devices —concentration, meditations, therapies, austerities, *martial arts*,whatever — are only to create situations where awareness can begin to arise, where the dreamer can begin to awaken. We can go on cutting a few leaves off the tree in our life, trying to improve this or that, but the leaves just keep growing back. Or we can cut the root.

```
austerities 苦行;禁欲;
martial arts 武术
```

Jesus said, “I bring a sword.” It’s all very well to love everything, but sometimes we need a sword too, in this sense:Sometimes when we’re sitting for long periods in meditation,“just sitting,” we need to face the fear or the anxiety or the boredom and just not move. <font color=red>Just be unmoving in the face of those things that we’ve always moved away from before.</font>

The sword that actually cuts the root of the mind is this unflinching awareness. What we’re doing, the lifestyle we’re leading, the methods we’re using are of little importance. Awareness of what we’re doing is the key. For awareness leads to silence, and silence in turn leads to deeper awareness; at bottom, they are the same. Awakening is going so far into the present moment that you can’t get back out.




## Chapter Thirty-six
Watch. We’ll see that <font color=red>we create our version of reality by what our attention is focused on.</font> “The floor.” We just created the floor by bringing our attention and energy to it.

What is the difference between attention and awareness? Simply that **attention is directed, focused, while awareness is non-directed, passive.** One way of putting it is that <font color=red>**awareness is noticing what we notice**</font>. It’s noticing the labels,discriminations, responses, models, activities, evaluations and demands that constitute our version of reality.

And as awareness develops, it becomes obvious that we are entirely responsible for the reality that we live in, because it’s our version of it. God is not responsible. The world is not responsible. We are responsible. Our experience of reality is our own creation.

<font color=red>The world is a perfect echo of us</font>. It is like standing in a canyon. If we shout “God!” we’ll hear “God!” back. If we shout “Hate!” we’ll hear “Hate!” back. We hear our own projections. The river mirrors our own struggles. For instance,the qualities that annoy us about others are projections of qualities that we ourselves have. Otherwise, we would notice them but they wouldn’t have any charge for us.

If arrogance in someone bothers us it’s because we’re arrogant. If resentment in someone bothers us it’s because we have resentment. Otherwise it would make no impression on us, it would be irrelevant, it would have no more significance than the ceiling. The canyon echos us. And this is true in the widest sense. If the world seems violent, let’s look within at ourself. What is violent in us?

All this being so, **if we truly want to help the world then we can work on ourself. <font color=red>That is where it starts and ends</font>.** If we want to improve someone else then we can work on ourself. We’ll be surprised — as our own consciousness is raised we’ll find that the other person has “improved.” They are much more okay now. A miracle!

As our consciousness deepens we gradually find that we are living in a different reality. **The game is to work on ourself — not on others, not on the world.** The mind always finds wrongness and problems out there and then wants to solve them there, but the mind has created the wrongness and the problems in the first place. How can we ever solve something externally which is being created internally?

```
吾心即是宇宙，宇宙即是吾心。
```

A special trap is taking any of the concepts discussed here and using them to make others wrong. For example, **if we point out to someone that they are running a tape, we are the one who is running a tape — about them**. We are the one who is missing. In our universe, we are the person who has the opportunity to get off it. And there is no way to get off it and still be right. Working on other people is a good way to stay stuck in the mind. Let’s work on ourselves.

Does this mean that we never communicate how we feel if we're upset about something? Does it mean that we don’t ever correct “wrongness” if we feel that something can be constructively done? No. **The mind is always looking for rules with which to achieve certainty, but no rule is always appropriate.**

<font color=red>Let’s be a witness to ourselves. What stories or tapes are we running now? How are we creating our experience of the situation?</font> As Ken Keyes said, first become centered and then act. When we’re uncentered and upset in any way we’ll tend to create turbulence and disharmony whatever we do or say. So let’s let our *primary emphasis* always be our own consciousness. **Let’s slowly fall silent inside**.

```
浊以静之徐清。
```

**When we’re silent inside we’ll naturally, spontaneously do whatever is most appropriate, whatever might create the greatest overall harmony. There won’t be a decision involved,no rule to follow. It will happen of itself. We will literally beliving in a different reality, and the world will look entirely different to us, even though it’s entirely the same. What used to be problems will no longer be problems.**

So let’s not try to solve problems while staying attached to our stories. **Our individual problems are not the problem. The world’s problems are not the problem. <font color=red>A lack of consciousness is the only real “problem” in this world.</font>**

Always, our first priority can be to be more conscious of our stories about how others and this world and ourselves ought to be different — and how those stories are creating our sense of isolation and suffering.

**When we become more silent within it will all begin to work. We’ll experience the perfection of Existence, <font color=red>not as a concept but as an experiential reality</font>. Nothing will be seen as a problem, not even death. For when we’re really silent we’re gone, we are no more; we have joined Existence Itself. The drop has merged in the ocean.**

How then can death trouble us? Death is a problem to the mind, to “you” and “I.” How can disease or pain or loss or poverty or suffering or anything at all trouble us when we nolonger exist? Only the Ocean exists, and It’s not troubled. All we ever were was the disturbance, the mind’s movement. When that is gone, we too are gone. And so is death.

When we’re silent within we’ll be spontaneously loving and compassionate; we will be love, we will be compassion,but there will be no thought of “love” or “compassion.” It will just happen. And when we communicate with someone we won’t be dumping our tapes and justifications and blame on them, but simply sharing our experience.

Sharing is being responsible for our experience — “I had a thought just now that you’re conceited and I turned it around and saw how I’m conceited when I’m thinking that about you.” Dumping is when we put the responsibility for our experience out there — “You know, you’re conceited!”

Dumping activates the automatic mechanisms of others and creates conflict and estrangement. Sharing creates a communion; it makes us real to others, it makes us available. Then we’re not trying to protect anything, for example our story, for we’ve seen that there’s nothing to protect.

```
Sharing & Dumping
```

The mind always feels that certain things need to be protected for the sake of our survival. But what is really being protected? Yes, the mind itself, the survival programming itself. To the extent that we’re willing to share ourself with others, to that extent we weaken the hold of the mind and open up space with others instead of shutting it down. And we’ll see more and more that what we are protecting isn’t worth protecting, and conversely, that what is really worth protecting — **the vast pregnant spaciousness and emptiness** within that we really are — needs no protection at all.




## Chapter Thirty-seven
The person of final awakening is like the open sky. She is boundless, infinite. **The bodily form is merely a contact point with Existence itself.** And like the sky, her true dwelling place has no walls, no roof and no floor either. How to protect a dwelling place that has no structure and no location?

The liberated person has a body-mind package but she is not that package; she is the void, the emptiness out of which that package has arisen. How to protect an absence, a void? Since it cannot be harmed, there is no need to protect it and no possibility of protecting it. Consequently, **the person of awakening is totally open to life, totally transparent, totally receptive to all things.**

She says “yes” to all aspects of life without reservation. **The mind gathers energy and strength by saying “no” to parts of Existence. This is liked and that is disliked. But <font color=red>the person of wisdom says “yes” to all of it. And nothing is excluded, not even the mind</font>.**

For she knows that Existence is a vast mystery which cannot be penetrated. She knows that she knows nothing at all, and so she simply opens her heart. She trusts. She allows the river to carry her, she knows not where, she knows not why. But **with that trusting heart she experiences the bliss of allowing herself to be a part of the flow. Just to exist in each moment is a benediction.**

He has no attachment to particular concepts or beliefs,and so he’s willing to let others have them. He’s willing to let others be “right.” After all, each concept is part of Existence too, it is perfect in its own way. And **each person is a part of Existence, a part of God — so the divine is speaking through everyone.**

He sometimes uses the master Mahavir's logic when it’s appropriate. If someone makes a statement of some kind his attitude toward it might be, “Perhaps you are right.” He lets the other person know that he understood what was said, but he’s lost the compulsion to agree or disagree — least of all with philosophical or metaphysical systems. He’s receptive to all things large and small, including all concepts, but he’s not attached to any. He <font color=red>plays with them as what they are — toys in the sandbox</font>.

He has abandoned trying to know the how or why of Existence or of his situation, he’s abandoned gathering facts and data and answers and solutions. He’s willing to play with data and questions and so on, but doesn't take them seriously because he has accepted his complete ignorance.

Ultimately, Existence is unknown and unknowable. It is wild, mysterious, infinite, unboxable. The mind keeps trying to box it up and *pin it down*, but it isn’t boxable or pinnable. We can pin the butterfly down, but then it’s not a butterfly anymore; it’s dead.

Only the trusting heart really sees. As the fox said to the little prince, “It is only with the heart that one sees rightly;what is essential is invisible to the eye.” Facts, data, boxes do not touch what is essential.

Buddha used to tell a story about a man wounded by a poisoned arrow. His friends and relatives procure a physician to pull out the arrow, but the man says he won’t have the arrow pulled out until he knows the name of the man who wounded him and the name of his clan. And he won’t have the arrow pulled out until he knows the height of the attacker and his village and his race. And he will not have the arrow pulled out until he knows the type of feathers used in the arrow and the type of wood and the type of metal in the tip and many other things. Buddha points out that the man will die in the middle of finding all this out.

This is our situation. **We will die in the middle of collecting our data and answers and goals unless we awaken to our situation.** We might think we can go toward happiness like an arrow going towards the target. We might imagine it is a matter of getting certain things in place.

But <font color=red>aiming directly toward the target can sometimes guarantee that we’ll miss it</font>. For instance, someone lies back in a lake feeling the sun on her face. She’s not trying to accomplish anything; she’s relaxed, surrendered. And a moment may come when bliss descends on her. We hear about it, let’s say,and we go to the lake to find this happiness. We lie back in the lake waiting for the moment of bliss, but it doesn’t come.Why not?

Perhaps because we were direct. We sought directly. But **Existence is indirect. It moves through hints and whispers, It reveals itself through silence.** Only when all seeking is gone and we're willing to wait for all eternity with no striving, no desire, no goal, <font color=red>not waiting for anything in particular but just waiting for no reason — then, in that empty silence, Existence reveals Itself</font>.

The mind thinks it can find happiness, thinks it can find God, thinks it can find enlightenment. But what map will we use? And how can there be a map when there’s no address, no location?

When there is no more seeking after anything at all,when there is **simply waiting with no goal in mind**, then God finds you. The seeker is the sought. You are the goal.




## Chapter Thirty-eight
God finds us when we’re not away from home. But God can come only to us when we’re totally naked. **As long as we are clinging to something in our version of reality, God can’t come to us.** The Unlimited, so to speak, makes contact with us when we’re not clinging to something limited.

Sufis tell a story of blind men feeling an elephant. One feels the trunk and declares that an elephant is curving and long. One feels the ear and announces that an elephant is wide and flat. One feels the tail and concludes that an elephant is like a rope. **As long as we cling to our partial version of things we can never see the Real.**

Another example: Three people walk down the street. One is hungry and notices the different restaurants. One is lustful and notices the appropriate sex objects. One just had a wallet stolen and notices only the thief up ahead. All are on the same street, but all are in different versions of reality.

To see the Real is to be unencumbered by thoughts or desires about part of it; it is to have no identification left with anything partial. And this means to have no attachment even to any concept of God or Existence or enlightenment, because **all concepts whatsoever are partial**.

```
unencumbered [ˌʌnɪnˈkʌmbərd] 无负担的;没有阻碍的;不受妨碍的;没有作为抵押的
```

How can we leave our partial versions of reality behind when we're so mired in them? Awareness does it. We see that they are partial. We see moment-to-moment that our version of things is only a version and that it is not reality itself.

**We observe ourself moment-to-moment — what we are doing, what we are thinking and feeling, how we’re reacting towards this and that.** As this continues, the thoughts of the mind gradually die down, and we begin to notice the gaps between our thoughts like the clouds parting and allowing a glimpse of the sun. Then we begin to enter the Silence where we encounter Existence itself. And one day when the Silence is complete we disappear and then, in this metaphor, God can truly play the divine Song through us.

<font color=red>The ultimate value of awareness, therefore, is that it leads to Silence and Stillness within us</font>. And in that Stillness,Existence is. God arises. The Self is “born.” Existence, Self —whatever the name — was always there but wasn’t noticed because of the incessant activity, the incessant static of the mind’s beliefs and clutchings.

Silence then, as Ramana Maharshi once said, is the true instruction. There’s no teacher like Silence. It is incomparable. Mind is like the surface of a lake when one is trying to see into the depths. When the surface is choppy and agitated, the depths cannot be seen. Once the surface is still and silent,though, the depths can be seen easily. They were always there but could not be observed.

The value of concentration meditations — focusing on an object such as a mantra, an image, a koan, the breath, and so on — is that they can still the waves of the mind and thus give a taste of Silence. However, the effect is only temporary.The mind is being suppressed, that’s all; it does not fall, it is not extinguished. Concentrations are an activity of the mind,they are the mind suppressing and drugging itself. They’re a form of getting high, and so we have to gradually come down when the concentration ends.

**Concentration is an active awareness and not the true,passive awareness. Instead of being an effortless witness to the flow of leaves down the river, concentration is focusing on a particular leaf. It is attached rather than detached, of the mind rather than the Self.** Concentration is thinking, it is the mind addressed in some particular direction. Yet it can be a useful device. It can give a glimpse through the door. And its power of focus can assist our awareness in going deeper.

But true meditation is awareness — passive, choiceless awareness, the witness. It is this which can still the waves forever, which can uncover Silence permanently. It is through awareness that a moment can happen from which there is no slipping back, no coming down.

For only through awareness can one see **the illusory nature of the mind and its survival-oriented thinking.** Only through awareness can we awaken and see that the mind is not actually there, that the tapes are simply what they are and not reality, that the mind as self-determiner does not exist,that the “I” does not exist, that all the grasping and seeking and judgments and a version concerning the problems of life are the problem itself.

Only through awareness can we see that **at the deepest level there is nowhere to go, that the goingness itself was the problem, that this moment is all there ever is and that being aware is what there is to “do” with it.**

Beyond this awakening, however, is **a final awakening where we simply disappear**. This is the final extinguishment of all qualities that we’ve thought of as ourself. It is total Silence and Stillness, the final annihilation of all thoughts, tapes, programs, desires, disturbances. We can use thoughts, of course,but it is like picking up a ruler to draw a line. When there is no more use for the ruler, it is laid down; there is simply. Silence, Spaciousness.

**Then we have attained to being a nobody, a nothing.** Now rivers flow in us, stars are born in us, the wind blows through the trees in us. There is the bliss of Existence Itself, a bliss which transcends what is normally thought of as joy and happiness in human life.

In this state of final awakening, <font color=red>**everything that would have to be given up at physical death has already been given up before physical death**</font>. The body is still alIive, but now there is no inhabitant anymore. This awakening, therefore, is truly a dying. **It is death. Not bodily death, but the death of “you”or “I,” the death of the mind, the illusory controller.**

It’s the death of everything we’ve ever associated with“you” or “I.” Everything has been thrown, nothing is carried any longer. The luggage full of stories and tapes and desires has been put down forever. We leave behind all our burdens,including the ultimate burden — the separate “I.”

Now death has no hold anymore. Death is dead, for we have already died. In that death we are reborn, but it is not us. Now we are not, but God is. **God has been “born” through our absence. The Existence lives and breathes through the vessel now. It’s like the open sky — eternal, deathless.**

The Existence expresses through a human form. Then we are Everything and Nothing. We are Oneness and the Void. Who we are now was never born, so it cannot die. Both life and death have been transcended. Such a person, as Jesus said, is in the world but not of it anymore. And the Ocean itself rises in the wave.




## Chapter Thirty-nine
Is an innocent young infant in this state? Is an animal enlightened? In one sense they are because there is no mind,there is no rational-controller. There is no problem about life because there is no past or future, no expectations or models,no concepts or comparisons. There is just life from moment to moment. On the other hand there is strong instinctual, lower-brain programming to survive and avoid extinction. **In contrast, an awakened being has no desire to seek or avoid extinction, because the separate “I” has already become extinct.**

But this isn’t the crux of the matter. What about a cloud or *a blade of* grass? Now there is no desire even to survive.There is simply the bliss of perfect harmony with Existence. Are they enlightened? No.. .and now we come to the heart of it.

There is no possibility of a cloud or a leaf or a wave awakening because they aren’t conscious. Only humans — or any other sentient beings — can become **self-realized**, for only sentient beings are conscious. **Only humans or other sentient beings have the capability to experience the hell of consciousness, the hell of mind — and that is what we do experience.** But this hell also contains the seeds of another possibility.

```
the hell of mind
```

To be conscious means to be split, to be divided. The mind is always trying to be somewhere other than where it is. The conscious mind is pulling in one direction and the unconscious conditioning is pulling in another. Or the desire system wan‘ts something other than the Reality herenow. One is not whole. This is the anguish, the tension of mind.

As Osho says, entities who don’t have sentience have no tension because they’re unconscious; then there is no problem. And the free being has no tension because they are conscious completely; then there is no problem either. Only we humans and other sentient beings are partial; **only we live in the hell of being divided**. But this partial consciousness means also the possibility is there of becoming completely conscious.

**Awakening means first going to hell and then coming back to paradise**. Liberation means first battling and struggling with the river and then seeing the illusion and ceasing the struggle... through awareness, through silence, through the extinguishing of who we think we are.

The tragedy of the human is that only he or she truly suffers. No animal, no plant, no river can suffer as humans do because there is no mind to struggle, no mind to live in the past and future, no mind to compare and judge and crave. **Self-realization has depth to it because it has first known the misery of mind.**

```
作为一个有自我意识的人，从mind的幻象中清醒，“复其初”。
```

This is why a fetus, even though existing in bliss, isn’t awakened — it is not yet conscious. **One must pass through the pain of partial consciousness before the doors of heaven can open in complete consciousness.**

And then deliverance is here, in this life. In one sense,the pathless path to awakening can be considered a regression back through the history of the organism to life in the womb. As awareness deepens, we go back through a psychodynamic stage, bringing consciousness to and disappearing the tapes formed by painful and traumatic incidents in childhood.

```
psychodynamic [ˌsaɪkoʊdaɪˈnæmɪk] 心理动力;精神动力学;精神动力;以心理动力学;精神动态
```

Then as awareness increases further we undergo a kind of birthing stage, confronting the human condition of pain and suffering, dying and death and the desire for survival —corresponding to the agony of the fetus as it dies as a fetus inorder to be born.

Finally, as awareness becomes complete, one goes back to a transpersonal reality. The fetus is in undisturbed peace,undisturbed bliss. It has no sense of “I,” no desires, no urge to get somewhere, to control. It simply is, and there is no problem whatever. The awakened person is like this, but there is a crucial difference — where as the fetus is unconscious, the self-realized person is totally conscious. Both are in bliss, both have no identity, no mind, but one is conscious and the other is not. To have no mind, no ego, no disturbance within, yet to be fully conscious — this is liberation.

How do we reach it? “You” and “I” can never reach it because we are the obstacle. **Only when we disappear can it be reached.** Indeed, the moment we are not, It is already there. But **we cannot attain to our own non-existence**; there is noway for us to reach that, for the very attempt to reach keeps “us” in existence. **All that can be done is to cultivate the ground — and then it happens of its own accord**.

Existence does it. It’s like the farmer growing his crop. He tills the soil, plants the seeds and then waits. He must have great patience. By and by, Existence Itself brings the crop up out of the soil. Yet the farmer also makes a contribution. And when awakening happens it’s clearly a grace bestowed by the Whole; there is clearly no doer except the Totality. And yet we contribute too, by tilling the ground.

And how is the ground tilled? How is the seed planted? Through the non-doingness of awareness, mindfulness. But awareness can only become fully mature in perfect silence and stillness. So like the farmer, we set aside periods of just sitting silently and waiting. Unlike the farmer, though, we wait not for anything in particular, but for nothing at all.

We are just waiting. Waiting with an open heart, with a trusting heart. **We can reach a point where even the goal or concept of awakening is no longer there, where we’re prepared to just wait with no end or goal for all eternity.** We can reach the point where time drops away from us, when we see our own uselessness, when we see that the world is doing just fine without us and that we’ve been discarded, thrown on the junk pile. **Only when time drops from us completely has the mind also dropped.**

We cultivate then **the greatest art, the art of just sitting silently**. But sitting silently in great awakeness, consciousness,awareness. **It’s simply stopping, it is simply coming to a halt. It’s allowing the waves of the mind to subside, it’s allowing the bicycle to come to a stop and then just topple over. It is the ultimate in doing nothing.**
And in that absence Existence reveals Itself.
The Zen master Zenrin said:
**Sitting silently, doing nothing,**
**Spring comes and the grass grows by itself.**
**Sitting silently, doing nothing, we imperceptibly merge into a harmony with the Existence... which is not trying to get anywhere, which is not trying to accomplish anything, which is simply the bliss of being what It is.**

```
imperceptibly 极微地；微细地；察觉不到地; 不知不觉地
```




## Chapter Forty
**Sitting silently, doing nothing, waiting for nothing, just waiting — with no end in view, with no goals or desires or attachments, simply being silent and aware.. .this is how the final awakening comes.**

In our ordinary life the mind pulls away from boredom because it needs excitement to stay alIive. It knows only two possibilities, movement or sleeping. If nothing is going on the mind is just bored, it wants to go to sleep. But **sitting silently,doing nothing is a third possibility — consciousness without occupation**.

It is the ultimate facing of boredom. It is going deeper and deeper into the boredom, into the emptiness, into the hollowness beneath all the onion-layers of the mind. It is penetrating deeper into tedium, into silence, into nothing, into lack of stimulation.

It can be done with eyes closed or open-and-unmoving,it makes no difference. The body is put into a relaxed position where it can be still for awhile. And then the essential thing is that we are no longer moving in a particular direction or dimension but are open to all dimensions, all directions.. .open to whatever is happening, open to the Totality.

An interesting metaphor:
Wakefulness is consciousness plus mental activity. Deepsleep is neither, it is unconsciousness plus mental inactivity. Dreams are activity without consciousness. But silent, open,aware sitting is the most interesting of all — it’s **consciousness without activity**. Appropriately enough, silent sitting is the opposite of dreaming.

In one sense, **this final awakening could be described as being in a state of deep sleep while being fully conscious**. In the normal waking state of the brain, beta waves of 14-26 cycles per second predominate. In the deep relaxation brought about by various concentration meditations we pass down to alpha waves of 8-13 cycles per second.

Then it was discovered that Zen monks who are experienced in mindfulness meditation pass down while remaining conscious to theta waves of 4-7 cycles per second, which are normally present only during the medium stages of sleep. And awakening might then be characterized as remaining fully conscious while passing down to delta waves of 0-4 cycles persecond, which are normally present only during the deepeststage of sleep.

Deep sleep is very beautiful. In deep sleep there are nothoughts, no desires, no tapes, no stories. There is no struggle,no striving. In deep sleep we are not a particular identity; infact, we are not anything at all, our identity is gone. There is no clinging, no mind, no “I.” On the other hand, there is no consciousness either. Freedom is adding consciousness to this state of inner stillness, and living in the world with it.

It is awareness without attachment, consciousness without an object. The only difference between ourselves and a Buddha, then, is that we have something that the Buddha doesn’t have. The Buddha merely has consciousness. We have consciousness plus stories and dreams. **Final liberation is the complete disappearance of all stories of the mind.**

In this state every moment of life is a benediction, a natural gratitude for the overwhelming loveliness and majesty of life. Every moment is a spontaneous prayer, a spontaneous surrender to Existence itself. But there is no decision to do or be these things, for there’s no one to make the decision. There is simply emptiness, open sky, and in that emptiness those qualities are just there.

There is bliss because all is as it should be: It’s perfect,It’s exactly the way It is. In a cloud, a leaf, an animal, a person is seen the Eternal, the Deathless, the Nameless. The face of the unfathomable Mystery is present everywhere.

```
unfathomable  [ʌnˈfæðəməbl] 深不可测
```

**The whole universe is seen in a river or a blade of grass,and yet, there’s no one to see it. It is the Existence Itself now who sees.** The old inhabitant and all her sufferings is gone;now God is the only inhabitant. God looks out at God. God sings a song to God. Infinity can be held in the palm of the hand. Less has become more, for there is a grace over the most mundane details of daily life, or over nothing at all.

```
一花一世界,一叶一菩提。
```

There is a kind of great drunkenness with life — but no drunkard, for no one is there. There is nobody, nothing. There is simply bliss, peace, grace, enchantment for no reason, nocause. It’s just the quality of the Mystery.

```
enchantment [ɪnˈtʃæntmənt] 魅力
```

In this state life is like the notes of a symphony, in Alan Watts’ great metaphor. There is no attempt to get to the end of anything, for each moment is the whole point. Each note is precious, perfect, needed, complete in itself.

The purpose of all of Reality is now gathered into each timeless instant, the eternal present.

Life is now like listening to the rain — each drop of rain a brilliant jewel, the scripture of Existence. There is only the rain, the sound of the rain, the suchness of the rain. There is no mind, no awakening, no awareness, no listener. There is no anything anymore. All things have merged into emptiness,the void.. .Nothing. Now there is only the pat-pat-pat of the rain itself, vanishing into silence.



# Afterword

The true revolution is always the same. It lies not in attempting to change things to the way our mind wants them to be, but in waking up to find ourselves in love with the way they are. Theres no logic to it; its an illogical falling in love with all of Reality as It is. Its waking up from the dream-sleep of stories and attachments we normally call being awake.

To do this great attentiveness is needed. This brings the transformation. Actually, such mindful awareness is itself the transformation, for nothing additional needs to be done. In that pure fire, certain things will drop away. All things will become new even as we change nothing.

```
attentiveness 注意力；专注
```

But this mindfulness is subtle. **The difference between running the tapes of the mind and watching them as they run is microscopic, a hair’s breadth. Yet that difference ultimately is very vast.** In other words, it takes a lot of alertness to be alert. And if you’re like me, you’ll forget over and over.

It’s good to allow ourselves some time each day to sit silently, to be aware in silence. In effect, we just sit on the bank and watch the mud in the pond begin to settle by itself — for that is its natural tendency when it isn’t being continuously stirred up by the mind’s motion.

We don’t need to be unduly concerned about the “right”posture, schedule or technique. An undue concern would just create more tension. **There are many useful devices, such as verbalizing our watching or mentally sweeping the body, but ultimately they have to be allowed to drop or they become part of the obstacle.** Ultimately, awareness has to stand completely on its own. Since it is your unique journey, the natural rhythms that are right for you will eventually find you.

As the mind quiets down — or perhaps more accurately,as it becomes more absent — the infinite Mystery, the **undying Intelligence** will manifest more and more within us. We can’t ever leave It, for It is us, yet paradoxically we journey far afield before awareness or total exhaustion allows us to discover that we have always been home.

I am also on this journeyless journey with you. For all of us, there is no limit to how far we can walk into this limitless,mysterious Ocean that is ourselves.

On this journey to yourself, this pathless path that leads to where you are — to where “you” aren't — may you experience much love. And may you experience the peace that passes all understanding.
